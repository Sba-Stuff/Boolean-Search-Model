cant manage it. Firstly, the firm must collect data from its marketing channel. The firm needs to analyze data seriously 
to have a competitive advantage in the sector.  
Data Mining (DM), which is the process of automatically searching large volumes of data to extract knowledge 
from them a in a human-understandable structure, helps analysts to recognize relationships within data.  
Applying DM techniques to marketing data is extremely useful to find interesting, previously unknown, hidden 
patterns, which can then be better defined, in massive datase
ts. In this manner, DM helps to find important knowledge 

from the marketing channel. The achieved knowledge has a strategic importance in terms of competition and 

improvement of marketing and production for the firm.  This is because knowledge achieved can help to improve the 

communication between the marketing channel and the firm 
by better controlling the processes, and by knowing the 
details about them. 
One important type of knowledge that can be obtained from data mining is the decision tree (DT), which is 
constructed from existing data to classify future data. DTs are an effective method of classifying data set entries and 

can provide good decision support capabilities. DTs have seve
ral advantages over other data mining methods, 

including being human- interpretable, well-organized, computationally inexpensive, and capable of dealing with noisy 

data. Due to these merits, DTs are probably the most popular mining method [1]. There have been numerous studies 

in marketing which use decision trees (DTs) [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9].  
Among the data mining techniques, cluster analysis helps in the classification of data. Cluster analysis seeks to 
maximize between-group variances and minimize within-group variances, including both hierarchical and non-

hierarchical methods [10]. 
In the literature, Kohonens SOM is one of the techniques used for dimension reduction. Malone et al. [11]  
demonstrated a trained SOM (Self-Organizing Map) which 
could provide initial information for extracting rules that 
describe cluster boundaries. Wang et al. [12] used an SOM for pattern analysis and a fuzzy inference system to capture 

the chaotic trend to provide short-term (hourly) and long-term 
(daily) Web traffic trend predictions. Fessant et al. [13] 
used Kohonen SOMs and they showed how the mining of network measurement data can reveal the usage patterns of 

ADSL customers. Maiorana [14] proposed a feature selection method based on a clustering algorithm belonging to 

the Kohonen SOM family. Gomez-Carracedo et al. [15] ap
plied Kohonen SOMs to perform pattern recognition in 
four datasets of roadside soil samples obtained in four sampling seasons over a one year period. They used CART as 

an objective variable selection step before the SOM grouping. 
Eshghi et al. [16] compared 
three clustering techniques: 
traditional clustering methods, Kohonen maps and latent 
class models. Nohuddin et al. [17] introduced a technique 
that uses frequent pattern mining and SOM techniques to identify, group and analyze trends in sequences of time 

stamped social networks so as to identify interesting trends. In recent years, the Kohonen SOM method has been used 

in marketing [18, 19, 20, 21, 22]. 
In this research, we use CRISP-DM, which was developed in 1996 by analysts representing DaimlerChrysler, 
SPSS, and NCR. CRISP provides a nonproprietary and freely availab
le standard process for fitting DM into the general 
problem-solving strategy of a business or research unit. According to CRISP-DM, which is shown in Fig. 1, a given 

DM project has a life cycle consisting of six phases. The phase sequence is adaptive. That is, the next phase in the 

sequence often depends on the outcomes associated with the preceding phase [23].

The paper is organized as follows. The Kohonen Network (KN) is introduced in Section 2. Section 3 gives the 
details of the application. The conclusions are drawn in Section 4. 
2. Kohonen Networks 
The identification of information, or patterns, in large subs
ets of data is a property of the fields of data-mining 
and feature extraction. Unsupervised learning techniques are a subset of these fields which enable the identification 
and grouping of patterns without having seen that pattern before or having its key characteristics described; to do

, a simi
larity m
easure is defined and the g
roups are 
clustered tog
ether into a lowe

al space. Self- Organizing
 Maps
 (SOM) are one such 
technique which enable the ma
pping of d
ata with a large f
eature s
et into tw
o-dimension
al space. Mor
eover, 
SOMs 
allow the visu

ata structures
. These 
can then be used as a
n aid in identifying and 
classifyi
ng anomal
ies in the d
atasets [
26]. 
The go
al of 
SOMs is to c
onvert a complex hig
h-dimensional input sign
al into a simp
ler low
-dimension
al discr
ete map
. Thus, SOMs are very sui
table for cluster analysis, when the 
underlyi
ng hidden p
atterns among
 record
s and fields are s
ought. SOMs structure the output n
odes into 
clusters of n
odes, where n
odes in close
r proximity are m
ore 
sim
ilar to 
each othe
r than othe
r nodes that are farthe

SOM, which 
itself
 represents a sp

orks. KNs can be considered as 
a non-hierarchical method of clus

on-hierarch
ical methods of clus
tering, they assign an input v
ector 
to the n
earest clus
ter, on the basis of a 
predetermined dis
tance fun
ction, but they try to 
preserve a degr
ee of dependen
ce among the 
clusters by int
roducing a dis
tance between them. Consequen
tly, each output neu
ron has 
its own neigh
borhood, which is ex
pressed in 
terms of a dis

atrix. The output neu

r. 3.3. Decision tree inducti
on DTs are one of the 
popular methods that have b
een used for 
knowledge discovery in d
atabase
s. Tree models can 
be defined as a recursive procedure, through which a set on statistical units are progressively divided into groups, 
according to a division of an explanatory
 variable to split and the choice of a 
splitting rule for such variable, which 
establishes how to partition the observations. The main result of a tree model is a final partition of the observations. 

To achieve this it is necessary to specify stopping criteria
 for the division process[27]. DTs provide an easy to 
understand overview for users without a DM background with high classification accuracy. They also provide a tree 

model of the problem and various alternatives in an understandable format without explanation. The acquired 

knowledge is usually quite understandable and can be easily 
used to obtain a better understanding of the problem. In 
83 Esra Kahya Ozyirmidokuz et al.  /  Procedia Economics and Finance   27  ( 2015 )  77  84 
additi
on, DTs a
ssist in making d
ecisions with existi
ng inform
ation. They hav
e satisfactory performance 
even when 
the training data are highly uncertain [28]. In this study, a C5.0 DT model is run to build a DT for predicting the 
complaints of the marketing channels firms. The aim of the classification is to find similar data items which belong 

to the same class.  
Modeling is performed with C5.0, which is one of the 
popular DT modeling algorithms and an extension of the 
earlier well known algorithm ID3. A C5.0 DT model which is acceptable with 10 tree depths is achieved. The mean 

is 91.3 and the standard error is 1.4 for the cross validation. The relations and knowledge are acquired. 
 One hundred and ninety one if-then rules are generated to express the process in English. The following examples 
illustrate some of the rules: 
 If the 
Number of trade marks
 > [ 4 ] and 
Profession
 is [ "Engineering" ] and 
Expectations from manufacturer 
are [Additional discount and term care]  then the 
firms complaint
 is [communicating problems], 
 if 
Educational status
 > [ bachelors degree ] and 
Profession
 is [ "wholesaler" ] and 
Expectations from 
manufacturer
 are [Additional discount and term care]  and
 Giro <= [15000000] then the 
firms complaint
 is [money collecting difficulties], 
 Stratified 
ten-fold cross-validation accuracy evaluation was used to train and test the data matrix. The accuracy 
rate of the model is 92.67 % which is shown in Table 2.

4. Conclusions 
Today, marketing channel decisions are as important as the decisions companies make about the features and prices 
of products [29]. In this research, we applied a DM fram
ework and we presented a decision tree induction from 
marketing channel data to improve the efficiency of the 
marketing system. DM techniques were implemented to 
marketing survey data. We explored the use of different pre-processing and DM techniques including anomaly 
detection analysis, Kohonen SOM, and C5.0 DTs. This research included attribute reduction using KNs. A C5.0 DT 

which was used for the classification of the data set with 10 tree depths was generated. The accuracy rate of the model 

was 92.67%. The DT model lays out the data matrix clearly so that all options can be explored. This acquired 

knowledge may be used to predict the future behaviors of
 the marketing channel firms. Data are processed into a 
manageable format, and decision rules are also generated. The DT model helps managers to understand the marketing 

channel firms. This research is also important to assess the future complaints of the firms and to plan future marketing 

developments. If we evaluate the current marketing channel and plan for capacity needs we will achieve a better 

marketing system performance. Consequently, the knowledge obtained will improve the performance of the marketing 

system. 
Alternative DM techniques using artificial intelligence methods can be studied in future research to compare 
various approaches and to implement this framework.
