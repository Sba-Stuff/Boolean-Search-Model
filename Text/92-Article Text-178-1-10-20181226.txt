 IoTCP: A Novel Trusted Computing 
Proto
col for IoT
 Shuangbao (Paul) Wang, Amjad Ali, Ujjwal Guin, Anthony (Tony) Skjellum
  Abstract 
- The ability to understand, predict, secure and exploit the vast array of 
heterogeneous network of things is phenomenal. With the ever
-increasing threats to cyber
 physical systems and Internet of Things, security on those networks of data
-gathering sensors 
and systems has become a unique challenge to industries as well as to military in the battlefield. 
To address those problems, we propose a trusted computing prot
ocol that employs discrete 
Trusted Platform Modules and Hardware Security Modules for key management, a 

blockchain
-based package verification algorithm for over
-the
-air security, and a secure 
authentication mechanism for data communication. The IoT
-based T
rusted Computing 
Protocol implements integrated hardware security, strong cryptographic hash functions, and 

peer-
based blockchain trust management. We have tested the protocol under various 

circumstances where devices have built
-in securities while others 
do not. We apply the new 
protocol to a SCADA system that contains more than 3,000 edge devices. The preliminary 

results show that proposed protocol establishes trust, improves security, integrity, and privacy.

 1 INTRODUCTION
 The Internet of Things (IoT) is fed with billions of devices and trillions of sensors. 
IoT networks undergird critical infrastructure, such as electric grids, transportation 
hubs, and nuclear power plants. They also link to systems
 containing valuable and 
sensitive personal information, such as hospitals, schools, and government 

institutions. A failure in of one of these systems or a cascade of such failures across 

systems, either in their operations or security, could lead to poten
tially catastrophic 

consequences for the population of that region, city and beyond [15, 29]. Yet many 

of the hardware and software elements used to control, monitor, and connect these 

systems are not designed with built
-in security, while others are outmo
ded and may 
not interface with newer technologies. For this reason, every IoT project must 

address the security and trust, and that can be hardened against tempering and 

compromise [30]. The ideal IoT, Internet of Battlefield Things (IoBT), and Cyber 

Physi
cal Systems (CPS) should be able to continue operating under attacks, and 
provide guaranteed performance [25
28]. Therefore, it is critical to secure edge 
devices and actuators, and make IoT networks resilient in the face of cybersecurity 

threats [1, 2, 10, 30].
 To ensuring the security and authenticity of IoT infrastructure is challenging 
since the edge devices have been manufactured in an environment with limited 

trust and government oversight [30]. These devices often have resource constraints 

such as lo
w power requirements, low area budget, limited memory, and/or 

extremely low
-cost. The attacks can originate either from the hardware or the 
software. Hardware attacks against a system can occur with physical tampering of 

an edge device and/or by the introduction of a cloned/counterfeit device into the 

IoT system [31
-35]. On the other hand, software attacks against the system can be 
performed through network attacks, such as Phishing, Denial of Service (DoS), and 

data spoofing [36
-37]. 
 Trusted Computing (TC
) is to guarantee the trustworthy of IT systems [8, 9]. 
It has shown promises in research, industrial projects [22], and military 

implementations. Practically, deploying a large system with Trusted Computing

 Base (TCB) is still a challenge especially in Io
T systems, where various protocols 
and legacy systems exist. 
 This paper first discusses security issues in IoT/CPS systems and then proposes 
a novel IoT
-based Trusted Computing Protocol (IoTCP) that integrates hardware 
security, strong cryptographic hash 
functions, and blockchain technology to 
establish trust among devices and to secure data communications. We apply 
machine learning and intelligent services to deliver adaptive cyber
-physical 
capability and services necessary to enable effective command and
 control across 
IoT/CPS systems. Finally, we illustrate an implementation of a testbed SCADA 

system with a dashboard and data analytics features.
 2 BACKGROUND
 Trusted computing is to build digital identities and increase assurance of trust 
among 
devices that are connected to the network. It adds a level of security on top 
of what is provided by the operating systems and hardware. Trusted computing base 

adds a hardware device, which has non
-volatile storage and cryptographic execution 
engines on ea
ch device.
 Trusted Platform Modules (TPM) and Hardware Security Modules (HSM) are 
cryptographic hardware that improve the overall security of a system. TPM is 

usually embedded into a device. For a device that do not come with a TPM, an 

HSM can be added. 
 Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) [12] is a device
-to-device IoT 
connectivity protocol. It has the advantages of small code footprint, low network 

bandwidth requirement, and lightweight therefore a good candidate especially for 

IoT/CPS systems. 
 A bl
ockchain is a distributed ledger [13]. For IoT/IoBT/CPS systems, it records 
all actions and operations [6]. Each block contains the data and a hash of a previous 

block. If any of the previous block is tempered with, it will affect the hash of the 

current b
lock. The temper
-proof property makes it a perfect candidate to guarantee

 packages authenticity for over the air updates. Guin et al. recently proposed to 
integrate blockchain technology to authenticate resource
-constrained, low
-cost 
edge devices [38]. SRA
M-
based physically unclonable functions (PUFs) were used 
to generate a unique digital fingerprints to identify edge devices.
 2.1 Trusted Platform Modules
 A TPM is a robust chip that is integrated into the systems providing hardware 
security and establishing 
trust within devices such as computers, weapons, vehicles, 
robots, wearables, actuators, and storage [5]. TPM enables server, gateways, and 

sensors to extend secure authentication [8, 11] and integrity with a TPM chip on 

each device. Mutual authentication 
of devices is required at session start and signing; 

and decipher are performed on the device [4]. 
 TPMs are basic building blocks used in many specifications, for providing an 
anchor of trust. They can be used for validating basic boot properties before 

allowing network access, or for storing platform measurements, or for providing 
self
-measurement to provide anchors of trust to hypervisors (in virtualization). The 
TPM 2.0 Profile Specification allows subsets of proven security to be implemented 

in a varie
ty of devices, from traditional clients to embedded and IoT systems, with 
smaller footprints, lower power consumption, and lower cost [16].
 2.2 TPM-
based Security Systems
 Bosch uses TPM in its cameras and other edge devices that act like a 
cryptographic coprocessor to the device. The TPM runs its own firmware, which 

is continuously maintained to provide optimal protection against possible threats 

known to the threat intelligent sensors [18]. Communication between the device 

firmware and the TPM chip happens via
 a secure agent inside the TPM. TPMs 
provide application program interfaces and commands for applications. It is 

impossible for the firmware or operating systems (OS) to modify anything inside 

the TPM directly.

 Chrome OS uses TPMs for a variety of tasks, 
including software and firmware 
rollback prevention, protection of user data encryption keys, and attestation of the 
mode of a device [7]. 
 Microsoft Windows OS uses TPMs to offer features such as disk encryption, 
virtual smart cards, and device health att
estations [14]. During the start
-up process, 
the TPM releases the decryption keys only after comparing a hash of the OS 

configuration values with a snapshot taken earlier. This verifies the integrity of the 

Windows OS start
-up process. 
 Virtual smart cards
 use TPM to emulate the functionalities of physical smart 
cards, rather than requiring the use of a separate physical smart card and reader. 

Virtual smart cards are created in the TPM and offer similar properties to physical 

smart cards. Their keys are not
 exportable from the TPM, and the cryptographic 
component is isolated from the rest of the system [7, 14].
 2.3 Hardware Security Modules
 A hardware security module (HSM) is a hardware appliance that provides secure 
key storage and cryptographic operations within a tamper
-resistant hardware 
module [1]. HSMs provide both logical and physical protection to those devices, 

including cryptographic keys, from non
-authorized users and potential adversaries. 
The cryptographic function handled by most HSMs are asymmetric
 key pairs (and 
certificates) used in public
-key cryptography [3, 19]. Some HSMs can also handle 
symmetric keys and other arbitrary data.
 2.4 Challenges with TPMs and HSMs
 Though TPM provides a good level of security, abusing remote validation by 
manufacturers
 may decide what software would be allowed to run. In addition, the 
user actions may be recorded in a proprietary database without the user actually 

knowing. This has happened in smart TVs, smart toys, and other voice
-activated 
devices. As a result, privacy becomes an issue. Modern HSMs allow disabling certain 

functions in a lock
-down mode to improve security. However, an attack may

 extract a number of bits from a secret key and use the short key to launch a brute 
force attack (CVE
-2015-5464). Hash Message 
Authentication Code (HMAC) 
obfuscates private keys makes it hard to steal. However incidents such as replay 

attacks may still occur, due to the fact that the hash value is a constant over time. 

More cryptographic features must be added to avoid such attack
s.
 3 DESIGN OF A SECURE T
RUSTED COMPUTING PRO
TOCOL
 IoT devices such as IP cameras are the most exposed devices facing the most 
threats. Besides cyber threats, data can be hacked and stolen. Such might happen as 

the ultimate attempt by an attacker to retrieve
 certificates and keys to later
-on simulate an edge device by his own equipment, trying to hack deeper into the IoT 

systems [3]. 
 To build trust and secure communications, we propose a novel protocol that 
uses discrete TPM (dTPM) and HSM for establishing t
rust and key management. 
We use HMAC to generate strong cryptographic key and use MQTT protocol for 

authentication and data communication.
 3.1 Key Management with Discrete TPM
 A discrete TPM is an isolated, separate feature chip that all necessary computing 
resources are contained within the discrete chip package. A discrete TPM has full 
control of dedicated internal resource including RAM, non
-volatile memory, and 
cryptographic logic. Due to the architecture, vulnerabilities exist. 
 A device without a TPM must
 store private keys in its file system, where it 
might reside in an especially encrypted file but the key to this must also be stored 

somewhere in the file system. If hacking into a devices certificate store does not 

reveal what is being looked for, a sid
e-
channel attack may do, such an attack uses 
analytic hardware equipment to listen to the data of the system while performing 

its tasks. When triggering the authentication process, at some point, the key will 

appear unencrypted. This leaves vulnerabilities
 to attackers.

 IoT systems consist of a network of devices, gateways, and sensors. Many are 
not security
-enabled, which run on a variety of old protocols. Since dTPMs are 
only integrated into some devices, those do not have built
-in dTPMs are not able 
to use the security protocol. To solve this problem, we use HSM to provide 
hardware security.
 3.2 Package Verification with Blockchain
 Private keys, if loaded with a certificate, are stored inside the TPM and then are 
no longer retrievable. They can then only be used through cryptographic operations 
provided by the TPM, specifically its secure agents. The private key is password 

protected and is secret until safe storage within the TPM. The encryption engine 

provides key handling support for symmetrical encryption
 such as AES with up to 
256-bit key length. Once the key is delivered, the AES encryption or decryption 
for communication or over payload is then done by the hardware accelerated 

encryption engine in the main CPU. 
 We implemented a Multi
-Factor Package Ver
ification algorithm (MFPV) for 
private management and over
-the-air update security. MFPV has a secure 
cryptographic hash (H) that hashes a message along with the key. It is 

computationally difficult to create the same hash without the key. The original 

mes
sage with its hash value can only be verified at an edge device with the same 

key. Note that the hash is computed twice in order to resist some forms of 

cryptologic analysis such as the birthday attack or Nostradamus attack [17]. Software 

packages are hash
ed first on the gateways before sending to the edge devices. When 
a package is pushed to an edge device, the device broadcasts a ledger to form a 

blockchain to guarantee authenticity and to prevent modification. The detailed 

package verification steps are 
as follows:
 Step 1.
 A hash is computed using MFPV algorithm using the equation: 
  MFPV (H, key, message) = H(APPEND(message, H(APPEND(key, 
 message)
)

  where, key is a unique ID on an edge device. The transmitting message 
 to be delivered as follows: 
  APPEND(message, MFPV (SHA3, key, message))
  For SHA3
-512, we can obtain equivalent security of 256 bits. Here, 
 the block size is 576 bits with unlimited m
essage size. HMAC with 
 SHA3 [19] has been mathematically proven strong in counter attacks. 
 However, data leaks could still happen if a gateway is compromised.
 Step 2.
 Each edge device serves as a sensor by broadcasting to the network 
 notifying a new package has been published and verified by the device. 
 The verification can be performed as follows:
 MFPV (APPEND(message, MFPV (APPEND(key, message))
  where, key is obtained directly from the Non
-Volatile Memory 
 (NVRAM). The information 
(ledger) each device broadcasts forms a 
 blockchain, which is resistant to package modification.
 Step 3.
 After a blockchain is verified, a confirmation is sent out to indicate the 
 package is trusted.
  Step 4.
 With both a correct hash value and the confirmation from peers
  
in 
 the blockchain, the edge device starts the OTA update.
 3.3 Light
-weight Secure Authentication
 For secure communication between edge devices and actuators, we use MQTT, 
a dTPM and a device SDK 
- 
client libraries to connect, authenticate, and exchange 
mess
age between devices and an actuator. MQTT enables low power usage, 
minimized data packets, small code footprint, and, most importantly, low network 
bandwidth. Its advantages make it a perfect candidate for sensor communication 

and mobile applications. As M
QTT supports TLS, mutual authentication can be

 implemented with strong encryption. MQTT consists of three main components: 
MQTT broker, MQTT subscriber, and MQTT publisher [12]. 
 We also use device shadows to replicate all connected devices such that each 
edge device has an identical shadow stored in the cloud. The device and its 

corresponding shadow are constantly compared making sure the integrity of data 

and interactions. In the event of a security breach, the monitoring agent will issue 

an alarm indicat
ing there is a conflict of states between the edge device and the 
corresponding shadow. An action must be taken to resume communication. Adding 

a device shadow can assure that a device can still interact with applications even 

when they are offline. The combination of MQTT and device shadow not only 

secures authentication and communication but also improves fault tolerance. 
 Figure 1 depicts the handshake process before a device is authenticated. The 
MQTT Broker can accept or reject the connection based on 
device authentication 
results. For secure communication, device authorization is necessary. The MQTT 

Broker checks the authorization policy to determine whether the device is 

authorized to publish/subscribe. When both authentication and authorization 

condi
tions are met, the device establishes its session to start communication.

 4 CASE STUDY AND PRELIMINARY RESULTS
 Using the newly proposed IoTCP protocol, we implemented on a water 
treatment SCADA system th
at has more than 3,000 PLCs [21, 24]. The data 
acquisition layer uses US Department of Defense developed API to collect data [20, 

21]. The defense
-in-depth architecture reduces the risk to CPS networks from 
being hacked or data from being stolen. We connec
t devices that are equipped with 
TPMs directly to the actuators using the newly developed security communication 

protocol. We add HSM modules to legacy devices so that they can connect with 

gateways with security and trust. The blockchain based package ver
ification 
algorithm ensures OTA security. Secure authentication with MQTT provides low 

bandwidth requirement and enhanced data security. Initial tests show that the 

proposed protocol has the advantages of easy connecting with various devices and 

reducing the risks of cyber intrusions, as a result of the lightweight and low 

bandwidth protocol. dTPM not only establishes trust between devices and actuators 

but also provides security for OTA updates. Figure 2 is a diagram of the water 

treatment SCADA system.

  11  IoTCP integrates dTPM
 and HSM to provide hardware level security, uses 
blockchain to improve OTA security, and uses MQTT with HMAT key scheme 
to secure authentication and communications.
 We utilized the research project as a case study in our master
-level cybersecurity 
courses
 [23, 29]. Students were divided into four teams. One team focused on 
overall security assessment and tested the IoTCP against a number of security 

assessment tools. The team especially focused on replay attack and remote rollback 

attack. The second team f
ocused on blockchain and MFPV package verification 
algorithm. The third team worked on secure communication, it verified the secure 

authentication protocol. The forth team built a dashboard to monitor and display 

the sensor data, service status and other d
ata analytics results.
 5 CONCLUSION
 IoT, IoBT, and CPS networks connect home appliances, sensors, traffic, vehicles, 
medical aids, weapons, smart grids, and industrial automation. The heterogeneous 

collection of microcontrollers, sensors, data interfaces and
 networks makes it 
difficult to establish trust and secure the data communication. IoTCP combines 

dTPM and HSM to secure key management, uses blockchain for package 

verification and OTA update security, and uses a low bandwidth and lightweight 

protocol 
- M
QTT to ensure authentication and communication security. 
Preliminary tests show that IoTCP is especially useful for connecting heterogeneous 

edge devices including legacy protocols. The device shadows add another level of 

security, enhance integrity and im
prove privacy. We are in the process of applying 
machine learning in modeling device behaviors based on the vast amount of xAPI 

data we gathered. Once the model is trained with acceptable accuracy, we will use 

it to predict whether a device can be trusted or actions have to be taken.
