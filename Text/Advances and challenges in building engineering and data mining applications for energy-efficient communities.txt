IntroductionCurrently the importance of improving building energy per-formance for saving energy and enhancing building sustainabilityhas been widely recognized. One effective way of achieving thisobjective is to uncover and extract useful knowledge from build-ing operational data (e.g. temperature, ow rate, power andThis is an Engineering Advance paper.Corresponding author.E-mail address: haghi@bcee.concordia.ca (F. Haghighat).equipment states) that contains abundant valuable informationon actual building performance. The widespread use of buildingautomation systems (BASs) enables a tremendous amount of build-ing operational data to be stored in building databases that alsocontinue to expand. This rapidly growing and gigantic body ofstored data, coupled with the need for data analysis, has gener-ated an urgent need for powerful tools that can extract hidden butuseful knowledge from large building databases.As an emerging and promising technology, data mining (DM)is a powerful and versatile tool to automatically extract the valu-able knowledge embedded in huge amounts of data. It can bedened in many different ways. As dened by Cabena, Hadjinian,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2015.12.0012210-6707/ 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Yu et al. / Sustainable Cities and Society 25 (2016) 3338Stadler, Verhees, and Zanasi (1998), DM is an interdisciplinaryeld bringing together techniques from machine learning, patternrecognition, statistics, databases, and visualization to address theissue of information extraction from large databases. In the pastseveral decades, researchers have been vigorously and successfullyapplying DM in many scientic, medical, and application domainssuch as banking, bioinformatics and new materials identication.Recently it has also been introduced into the building eld that is awell-t application area for DM, since it generates and collects vastamounts of data on system operation, occupant behavior, powerconsumption, climatic conditions and etc.In general, DM includes six categories of widely accepted andimplemented techniques (Usama, Gregory, & Smyth, 1996):Data classication (e.g. the decision tree method, support vectormachine (SVM) and articial neural network (ANN)),Clustering analysis,Association Rule Mining (ARM),Regression,Summarization, andAnomaly Detection.Readers may refer to (Jia, Kamber, & Pei, 2012) for detailedinformation of these techniques. These techniques can be broadlycategorized into predictive tasks and descriptive tasks (Jia et al.,2012). This paper reports an overview of the recent studies under-taking the two tasks in the building eld.2. DM applications in the building eld2.1. Predictive tasks2.1.1. Building energy demand predictionThe prediction of building energy demand plays an importantrole in improving building performance. An accurate predictionneeds to take various signicant inuencing factors of buildingenergy demand into consideration, such as weather conditions,HVAC equipment, building envelopes and occupant behavior. Thecomplexity and uncertainty of these factors further adds difcul-ties to improve prediction accuracy. DM techniques may make abreakthrough in dealing with this complexity and uncertainty.Zhao and Magouls (2012) indicated that DM techniques arevery applicable to building energy demand prediction since theycan deal with non-linear problems. ANN and SVM are the twomost widely used DM techniques for this application (Ahmadet al., 2014). Kumar, Aggarwal, and Sharma (2013) applied vari-ous ANN methods, including back propagation, recurrent ANN, autoassociative ANN and general regression ANN. The adopted ANNarchitecture signicantly inuences the coefcient of variation thatranges from 2% to 40%. They concluded that ANN is more suitablefor the prediction of a large set of parameters than any statisticaltechniques. Li, Ren, and Meng (2010) reported that in many casesSVM shows higher prediction accuracy than ANN. However, train-ing SVM can be a very slow process due to large volume of trainingdata. The usage of parallel SVM (Zhao & Magouls, 2011) might bea feasible alternative.Both ANN and SVM models operate like a black box, mean-ing that the model can provide a prediction but cannot provide ajustication for supporting the prediction. In order to overcomethis limitation, Yu, Haghighat, Fung, and Yoshino (2010) developeda building energy demand predictive model based on the deci-sion tree method. Its competitive advantage lies in the ability togenerate accurate predictive models (92% accuracy in their study)with interpretable owchart-like tree structures that enable usersto quickly extract useful information. However, the decision treemethod is basically developed for predicting categorical variablesother than for predicting numerical variables.Considering that different DM techniques have their own spe-cialties, strengths and weaknesses, it is not easy to nd the bestcandidate for the building energy demand prediction. The recentresearch trend is towards the integration of different DM tech-niques for more accurate prediction. For example, Chou and Bui(2014) developed an ensemble model by combining ANN andSVM to predict cooling and heating demand. In order to predictthe next-day energy consumption and peak power demand, Fan,Xiao, and Wang (2014) developed ensemble models by combiningeight base DM models and assigning each DM modal an optimizedweight based on genetic algorithm (GA). The results show that theensemble models achieve higher prediction accuracy than those ofindividual base models.2.1.2. Building occupancy and occupant behaviorBuilding occupancy and occupant behavior are recognized ascrucial factors inuencing the discrepancy between practical andsimulated building energy consumption. However, it is difcult toinvestigate them analytically and then to develop reliable predic-tion models due to their complicated characteristics and stochasticnature (Yu, Haghighat, Fung, Morofsky, & Yoshino, 2011a). To meetthis challenge, different stochastic models (e.g. using probabilisticmethods (Sun, Yan, Hong, & Guo, 2014; Stoppel & Leite, 2014) andthe Markov Chain method (Muratori, Roberts, Sioshansi, Marano, &Rizzoni, 2013)) have been proposed. However, the proposed mod-els are severely restrained by the limitation: The modeling processtends to be complex and advanced mathematical knowledge isrequired.In order to remove the above limitation, researchers haveattempted to establish DM-based models. For example, Basu,Hawarah, Arghira, Joumaa, & Ploix, 2013) developed a decision-tree based model for predicting occupant behavior at the appliancelevel in residential buildings. DOca and Hong (2015) proposed aDM methodology to model ofce occupancy patterns and work-ing user proles based on big data streams. They found that thedecision tree method is suitable for predicting the occupancy pres-ence, supported by Zhao, Lasternas, Lam, Yun, and Loftness (2014),who built the occupant behavior prediction models based on appli-ance power consumption data in a medium-size ofce building. Theresults of both studies indicate that the modeling accuracy is verysatisfactory. However, the developed decision-tree based modelsare static models that are hard to simulate the dynamic nature ofbuilding occupancy and occupant behavior.The main focus of future research should be placed on testingand comparing other dynamic DM-based models and integratingthem into building energy modeling programs like TRNSYS andEnergy Plus. In addition, more research needs to be conducted sothat architects and designers will benet from bridging the gapbetween actual and predicted building energy performance.2.1.3. Fault detection diagnostics (FDD) for building systemsAutomating the process of detecting equipment and systemmalfunctions and making a proper diagnosis can help to ensurestable or optimal building operation. In terms of the approach toformulating the diagnostics, FDD methods can be categorized asmodel-based methods, which are based on prior knowledge ofunderlying system physics, and data-driven methods, which arebased on historical data (Katipamula & Brambley, 2005).The requirement of prior knowledge, together with complexmodeling processes and heavy computational burden, imposessevere constraints on the application of the model-based meth-ods. Comparatively, the data driven methods are much easier to usesince the models are normally automatically generated. Various DMtechniques have been employed as data driven methods for FDD.Z. Yu et al. / Sustainable Cities and Society 25 (2016) 3338 35For example, Magouls, Zhao, & Elizondo, 2013) developed an ANNmodel based on the recursive deterministic perceptron (RDP) ANNto implement FDD at the whole building level. Moreover, they pro-posed a new fault diagnostic procedure for identifying and rankingabnormal equipment in the order of fault risk. Other DM techniqueshave also been employed for FDD such as cluster analysis (Khan,Capozzoli, Corgnati, & Cerquitelli, 2013), fuzzy logic (Lauro et al.,2014) and SVM (Mulumba, Afshari, Yan, Shen, & Norford, 2015).In order to take advantage of different DM techniques andachieve more robust models, hybrid approaches have beenproposed for FDD such as the combination of the SVM and autore-gressive model with exogenous inputs (ARX) (Yan, Shen, Mulumba,& Afshari, 2014) and the combination of ANN and subtractive clus-tering analysis (Du, Fan, Jin, & Chi, 2014). Experimental resultssuggest these hybrid approaches have higher prediction accuracyand lower false alarm rates than the application of single models.However, the above DM-based models, both individual and hybrid,focused on historical data and cannot be used for real-time FDD.Recently, researchers have shown interest in developing on-line FDD tools that can provide real-time or near-real-time updateson model parameters and predictions (Bonvini, Sohn, Granderson,Wetter, & Piette, 2014). DM techniques, particularly the SVM,have been utilized in these studies and shown great potentialfor real-time FDD since they prevent performing numerous time-consuming simulations (Yan et al., 2014). Future research shouldfocus on verifying prediction of models based on a real world dataset.2.2. Descriptive tasks2.2.1. Framework developmentThe diversity of DM techniques and their functionalities neces-sitates establishing and providing a framework for users who maynot have much knowledge and experience with the application ofDM. Basically, such framework needs to specify which DM tech-nique/algorithm can be used for building application and whichkind of pattern can be mined correspondingly. The ultimate objec-tive is to help users to develop a set of data analysis methodologiesso that they can solve the problems based on the framework. More-over, case studies also need to be conducted in order to demonstrateits effectiveness. The framework, together with the case studies,enables users to analyze building-related data more efciently.Both general and specic DM frameworks have been proposed inthe past several years (Yu, Fung, & Haghighat, 2013). General frame-works provide a DM technique pool and different patterns will befound given different DM techniques are selected and combined.Specic frameworks are targeted at exploring a specic patternsuch as occupancy patterns and designated DM techniques areused.Regarding general frameworks, Yu et al. (2013) estab-lished a four-component framework consisting of DM tech-niques/algorithms. They also proposed a step-by-step data analysisprocess that starts from problem denition to knowledge discov-ery. Fan, Xiao, and Yan (2015) developed a framework that mainlyincludes four phases: data exploration, data partitioning, knowl-edge discovery and post mining. Regarding specic frameworks,DOca and Hong (2015) developed a framework to discover occu-pancy patterns and working user proles in ofce spaces. Thedecision-tree method and cluster analysis were combined to pro-vide insights into patterns of occupancy schedules. However, theseframeworks involve limited DM techniques and so far relativelyvery few problems has been tackled with the involved DM tech-niques.DM frameworks can deliver a set of data analysis methodologiesto practical operation, and thus efciently generalizing the usageof DM techniques to a wider population. They provide an overviewand a standardized process of the usage of DM techniques. There-fore, more frameworks, particularly specic frameworks, and casestudies with high replication potential should be developed andapplied for different applications.2.2.2. Occupant behaviorDM techniques have also been employed to conduct descriptivetasks for occupant behavior in several studies. These studies focuson either one type of specic behavior in ofce buildings or fullpatterns of behavior in residential buildings. Their main objectivesare to discover behavior patterns and to identify and improve theeffect of occupant behavior on building energy consumption. Theobtained knowledge can be integrated into building energy simu-lation programs especially when setting up behavior schedules.DOca and Hong (2014) combined clustering analysis withARM in order to discover occupants window opening/closingbehavior patterns in a natural ventilated ofce building. Basedon cluster analysis, Yu, Fung, Haghighat, Yoshino, and Morofsky(2011b) developed a new methodology for examining the inu-ences of occupant behavior on building energy consumption whileremoving the effect of other factors such as climate and build-ing envelopes. Based on cluster analysis, classication analysis,and ARM, Yu et al. (2011a) developed another methodology foridentifying energy-inefcient behavior in residential buildings andproviding occupants with feasible recommendations to improvethem. It is worth mentioning that the effective usage of DMtechniques, particularly cluster analysis, for describing occupantbehavior is heavily dependent on the size of established databases,which normally are restricted by various factors such as budgetsand effort in practice.Due to its complexity and randomness, the interactions betweenoccupant behavior and other inuencing factors are still poorlyunderstood. Further studies on the DM-based methodologies areactively encouraged, and the combination of cluster analysis withARM deserves extra attention.2.2.3. Building modeling and optimal controlBuilding operational data contains valuable information that canbe extracted for modeling and identifying the hidden relationshipbetween different variables, thereby improving building operation.Also, coupling the information into building control systems canassist in optimizing building performance. A number of studieshave already been conducted on such information extraction.With the goal of improving building performance, DM tech-niques have been employed to model different performancevariables such as furnaces cycle idle time (Li, Miao, & Shi, 2014),thermodynamic properties of refrigerants (Kc ksille, Selbas , &S encan, 2011), appliance usage (Basu, Debusschere, & Bacha, 2012)and coefcient of performance for refrigeration equipment (Chou,Hsu, & Lin, 2014). For example, Ahmed, Korres, Ploennigs, Elhadi,and Menzel (2011) used Nave Bayes, decision tree and SVM tosimplify the procedure to establish models for predicting internalnatural lighting and thermal comfort. The results show the highprediction accuracy and reliability of these techniques. Based onthe BAS database of the tallest building in Hong Kong, Xiao andFan (2014) rst applied clustering analysis to identify the typicalbuilding energy consumption patterns, and then applied ARM toeach cluster for discovering the hidden associations among powerconsumptions of major equipment such as chillers and pumps. As aresult, decit ow in the chilled water system was found and abnor-mal operation of the primary and secondary pumps was detected.DM techniques have also been employed for HVAC system opti-mal control with the aim of minimizing the energy consumptionwhile maintaining indoor comfort levels. Generally these tech-niques are integrated into controllers in order to take advantage oftheir strengths. For example, based on the fuzzy logic method, ANN36 Z. Yu et al. / Sustainable Cities and Society 25 (2016) 3338and Genetic Algorithm, fuzzy logic controllers (Hussain, Gabbar,Bondarenko, Musharavati, & Pokharel, 2014), ANN controllers(Moon, Lee, & Kim, 2014) and GA-based controllers (Congradac& Kulic, 2009) were developed. These controllers have alreadybeen widely applied in the building eld and a large numberof studies can be found in literature that is not listed in thispaper.Existing studies have already demonstrated the capabilities ofDM techniques as a means to effectively help improving and opti-mizing building performance. Potential future research includesdeveloping more accurate and robust models, particularly a com-bination of mining techniques, that can be readily usable. Also,more practical applications of DM-based controllers need to beconducted in the building eld in order to evaluate their usability.2.2.4. Discovering and understanding energy use patternsBuilding energy consumption patterns, both frequent and infre-quent, usually can be used to help identify operation abnormalitiesand faults. Effective pattern recognition and corresponding knowl-edge extraction by mining building historical data or simulationdata can lead to energy savings and performance improvement.Relevant studies at both the whole building level and sub-systemlevel have been conducted in recent years.At the whole building level, Miller, Nagy, and Schlueter (2015)applied clustering analysis to aggregate frequent energy use pat-terns so as to generate proles that may benet future simulationmodel calibration. Lange, Rodriguez, Puech, and Vasques (2013)developed a 3D visualization tool that can be integrated into BASsto visualize data in an understandable way. The work is part of theRIDER project that composed of a set of DM techniques aimed atgaining insight into building energy use patterns. Based on ARM,Yu, Haghighat, Fung, and Zhou (2012) developed a methodologyfor examining all associations and correlations between build-ing operational data, thereby pinpointing energy waste as well asequipment faults. By mining simulation data, Kim, Stumpf, and Kim(2011) developed an overall data analysis process to nd importantpatterns in order to improve the energy efciency of building designduring the early design phase.At the sub-system level, an increasing number of studies (Lai,Lai, Huang, & Chao, 2013; Beckel, Sadamori, Staake, & Santini, 2014;Rollins & Banerjee, 2014) focused on the investigations on appli-ance usage patterns. Chicco (2012) provided an overview of theprevious literature on clustering analysis for grouping and min-ing electrical load patterns, particularly residential demand proles(Rhodes, Cole, Upshaw, Edgar, & Webber, 2014). Few studies furtherfocused on more specic appliance usage patterns such as lighting(Motta Cabrera & Zareipour, 2013).Patterns extracted from building historic data and simulationdata provide a deep insight into the way building occupants con-sume energy. Utilities, policy-makers, building owners, designersand operators may benet greatly from these extracted knowledge.Most existing studies are still focused on general pattern analysisover a long time length, limited by low resolution data available. Inorder to discover in-depth knowledge of building performance, thefocus of future studies needs to be placed on more detailed patternsbased on high resolution data such as 1-min data.3. Future directions and challengesConcluding remarksThis paper reviews the advances in the eld of building engi-neering and DM applications over the last several years. It hasbeen shown that DM techniques are an effective tool for extractinghidden but useful knowledge from building-related data, therebyimproving building performance. However, some important prob-lems limiting the applications still need to be addressed and moreeffort is needed. The following described the encountered andanticipated challenges, potential future developments and recom-mendations for the application of DM techniques to the buildingeld:(1) Low-quality data leads to low-quality data mining results. Akey challenge is how to improve data quality in terms of relia-bility, completeness, consistency and resolution. There are twomajor reasons for the lack of high-quality data: the lack ofwidely-accepted benchmarks for identifying the parameters tobe monitored and the lack of adequate sensors for collectingreliable and high resolution data that tend to be costly. More-over, for residential buildings, the energy consumption data arecollected from the monthly or annual bills from utility compa-nies. These highly summarized data are insufcient to conductdetailed data analysis. The fact that end-use data on householdappliance usage is seldom monitored adds great difculties toin-depth data analysis.(2) Wide and diverse applications have been found and variousDM techniques have been employed. However, considering thatDM is a relatively young and fast-growing discipline and newtechniques emerges, clearly the potential of DM to extract use-ful knowledge from building-related data has not been fullyexploited. In this view, building researchers and engineers needto keep an eye on the current trend towards the development ofDM techniques, such as scalable and constraint-based miningmethods, as well as their applications.(3) Previous studies indicate that the applications have severalimportant limitations. For example, although a deeper under-standing of the data can be gained, the process of modelconstruction and knowledge extraction relies heavily on usersprior domain knowledge (e.g. setting a threshold for ARM anddetermining the optimal number of clusters). Also, it is not intu-itive on how to utilize the discovered knowledge. More effort isneeded for the exploration of improving the efciency and easeof the mining process and result analysis. One possible directionto take is the introduction of action mining or prot min-ing that has shown some success in the business world. TheirDM results are not just a bunch of rules, but some suggestedactions to maximize the prot or revenue. Similar concepts maybe applicable in the building eld.(4) The increasing volume, velocity and variety of building-relateddata usually result in databases with sizes and complexitybeyond the ability of traditional statistical analysis methodsto process them efciently. Such databases can be consid-ered as Big Data that is a current topic under discussion inInformation, Communication and Technology (ICT) in build-ings experts. Based on the denition and existing applicationof DM to building-related data, DM is expected to play animportant role in establishing effective Big Data managementapproaches. From this perspective, it is highly recommendedthat future research pay more attention to the following points:Passing the information on the usefulness of DM applicationsin the building eld to policy makers and building owners sothat they will, in turn, be supportive for more applications;formulating acceptable benchmarks for identifying theparameters to be monitored;lowering the cost of monitoring and accessing building-related data;developing methodologies based on new DM techniques fordiverse applications;improving the presentation and visualization of DM results;andinvestigating multiple building blocks and communitiesbesides individual buildings.Z.
