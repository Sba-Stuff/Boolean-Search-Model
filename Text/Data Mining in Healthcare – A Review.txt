 Abstract 
The knowledge discovery in database (KDD) is alarmed with development of methods and techniques for 
making use of data. One of the most important step
 of the KDD is the data mining. Data mining is the 
process of pattern discovery and extr
action where huge amount of data is
 involved. Both the data mining 
and healthcare industry have emerged some of 
reliable early detection systems and other various 
healthcare related systems from the clinical and diag
nosis data. In regard to this emerge, we have 
reviewed the various paper involved in this field in
 terms of method, algorithms and results. This review 
paper has consolidated the papers reviewed inline 
to the disciplines, model,
 tasks and methods. Results 
and evaluation methods are discussed 
for selected papers and a summary of the finding is presented to 
conclude the paper.

1. Introduction  
Across all the fields, data 
are being collected and accumulated at a vi
vid pace. There is an urgent need 
for a new generation of computational theories and tool
s to assist humans in extracting useful information 
(knowledge) from the rapidly growing volumes of digital data. At the core of the process is the 
application of specific data mining 
methods for pattern discovery and 
extraction [1]. Among the data 
mining techniques developed in recent years, the 
data mining methods are including generalization, 
characterization, classification, cluster
ing, association, evolution, patter
n matching, data visualization and 
meta-rule guided mining. [2]. As an element of data mining technique research, this paper surveys the

 development of data mining technique, through a liter
ature review and the classification of articles from 
2005 until 2015
 are reviewed. The period is importan
t because, during the time period
 there is a newly 
widespread of data mining techniques being used in the healthcare industry where technology
 has played 
a significant role especially in the development of methodologies for the collection
 of data from online 
databases. The review interest for this literature revi
ew, started in the March 2015 with searches made of 
the keyword indices on the ScienceDirect, Springer
link and IEEE Xplore online databases, for full article 


2015, 3840 articles were found. Topic filtering reduced this number to 205 ar
ticles, which were related to 
the keyword. From the 205 articles, 50 articles is
 used for this review, the papers are collected based on 

. The 
remaining part of the paper is organized as follows
. Section 2.0 discusses the overview of data mining. 
While section 3.0 discuss the various data mining algorithms used in healthcare. 
 2. Data Mining An Overview 
 Data size are generally growing from day to day. 
The need to understand large, complex, information 
enriched data sets has now 
increased in all the varied fields of 
technology, business and science. With 
these large amount of data, the ability 
to extract useful knowledge hidden in these large amount of data 


process of applying computer based informatio
n system (CBIS), including new techniques, for 
discovering knowledge from data is
 called data mining [3]. The followi
ng subsections will be oriented to 
define the mentioned 
attributes of data mining, provide their related instances and insight some figures on 
their occurrence among the 50 articles mentioned in the section 1.0.
   2.1. Disciplines I
nvolved in Data Mining 
 The data mining baseline is grounded by disciplines such as machine learning [4], artificial 
intelligence [5], probability [6]
 and statistics [7]. The disciplines iden
tified among the papers reviewed 
are summarized in Table 1. Table 1 assets the di
sciplines mentioned for the papers reviewed.

 Generally, there are two kinds of data mining mod
els: predictive model and d
escriptive model  [8]. 
The predictive model often apply supervised learning 
functions to predict unknown or future values of 
other variables of interest [8]. Th
e descriptive model on the other hand, often apply the unsupervised 
learning functions in finding patterns describing 
the data that can be interpreted humans [8].

 Usually, the implementation of a model is made by
 a task. For instance, clustering [9], association 
rules [10], correlation analysis [11], are often us
ed for descriptive models. While classification [12], 
regression [13]
 and categorization [14]
 are used for predictive models. Table 3 shows the task derived 
from the papers reviewed.

 Having the data mining model and task defined, next would be the data mining methods to build the 
approach based on discipline invo
lved. The methods used for anomaly detection are, standard support 
vector data description, density induced support ve
ctor data description, Gaussian mixture. While the 
vector quantization method is widely
 used for clustering. The methods
 widely used for classification are 
statistical, discriminant analysis, decision 
tree, Markov based, swarm intelligence, k
-nearest neighbor, 
genetic classifiers, artificial neural networ
k, support vector and association rule. 
 3. Data Mining Algorithms in Healthcare
 Healthcare covers a detailed processes of the diagnosis, 
treatment and prevention of disease, injury and 
other physical and mental impairments in humans [15].  The healthcare industry in most countries are 
evolving at a rapid pace. The healthcare industry can 
be regarded as place with 
rich data as they generate 
massive amounts of data including electronic medical
 records, administrative reports and other 
benchmarking finding [16]. 
 These healthcare data are however being under
-utilized. As discussed in 2.0 
data mining is able to search for new and valuable information from these large volumes of data. Data 
mining in healthcare are being used mainly for predicting various diseases as well as in assisting for 

diagnosis for the doctors in making their clinical decisi
on. The discussion on the various methods used in 
the healthcare industry are discussed as follows.
   309 Neesha Jothi et al.  /  Procedia Computer Science   72  ( 2015 )  306  313 
3.1. Anomaly Detection 
    Anomaly detection is used in discovering the most si
gnificant changes in the data set [17]. Bo Lie et al 
[18] had used three different anomaly detection method,
 standard support vector data description, density
-induced support vector data description and Gaussian 
mixture to evaluate the accuracy of the anomaly 
detection on uncertain dataset of 
liver disorder dataset which is ob
tained from UCI. The method is 
evaluated using the AUC accuracy. The results obtain
ed for a balanced dataset by average was 93.59%. 
While the average standard deviation obtained from 
the same dataset is 2.63. The uncertain dataset are 
prone to be available in all datasets, th
e anomaly detection would be a g
ood way to resolved this matter, 
however since there is only one paper discussing
 this method, we cannot comment much on the 
effectiveness of the method. 
 3.2. Clustering
        The clustering is a common 
descriptive task in which on
e seeks to identify a finite set of categories or 
clusters to describe the da
ta [17]. Rui Velosoa [19]
 had used the vector quantization method in clustering 
approach in predicting the readmissions in intens
ive medicine. The algorithms used in the vector 
quantization method are k
-means, k
-mediods and x
-means. The datasets used in this study were collected 


conducted using the Davies
-Bouldin Index. The k
-means obtained the best results while x
-means obtained 
a fair results while the k
-mediods obtained the worst results. From the results the work by these 
researchers provide a useful result in 
helping to characterize the different 
types of patients having a higher 
probability to be readmitted. A more significant compar
ison on the method cannot 
be made since this is 
the only one paper in my review discussing on the vector quantization.
  3.3. Classification 
     Classification is the discovery of a predictive learning 
function that classifies a data item into one of 
several predefined classes [17]. The related work in classification will be discussed in the following 

subsections. 
 3.3.1. Statistical  The MTS algorithm is being extensi
vely applied in multivariable statistical analysis. The Mahalanobis 
distance (MD) is used to build statistical judgements
 to distinguish one group from another and the 
Mahalanobis space (MS) is used to
 represent the degree of abnormality of observations from the known 
reference group.
 In the statistical classifiers, the authors Su et al.
 [20], have used the Mahalanobis 
Taguchi System (MTS) to design the prediction mod
el for pressure ulcers. The class imbalance problems 
are very much prevalent in the healthcare datasets.
 Usage of the data mining algorithms are often affected 
with skewed distribution when using skewed or 
imbalanced data sets. This problem often leads to the 
tendency of producting highly predictive classification accuracy over the majority class and poor 
accuracy over the minority class.
 Having such a nature to distinguish the degree of abnormality of 
observations, this method would be 
a good method to test on the real
 data set pressure ulcers. This 
method is also used since the MD is sui
tably scaled. The test conducted using this algorithms were done 
in four phases with scaled datasets ranging from 14 to 8, 5, and 2 accordingly. The results obtained in the 
paper [20]
 shows that the measurement scale for this algorithm has good a performance based on the huge 
difference between the normal and abnormal examp
les. Being an algorithm which is suitable for scaling
 the
 MTS proves to have better sensitivity and g
-means values in the testing st
age. The MTS has enhanced 
performance in terms of sensitivity.

3.3.2. Discrimin
ant Analysis 
 Linear discriminant analysis
 (LDA)
 is widely used in discriminant analysis to predict the class based 
on a given set of measurements on new unlabeled observations [17]. Authors Armaanzas
 et al. [21] and 
Jen et al
 [22] have used the linear discriminant analysis in their respective work.
 Jen et al
 [21] had the 


atient using scores of non
-motor 
symptoms.
 Their study is intended to quantitatively anal
yze the inner relationships between both motor 
and non
-motor symptoms. The linear discriminant analysis is the conditional probability density function 
of the predicto


capture statistical dependencies among the predictor 
variables indicates that this algorithm would be 
suitable
 to explore the linear constraint of this study to discovery the synergy
 between motor and non
-motor symptoms. The proposed model obtained an ac
curacy estimation of 69% compared to other 


form. Based on the
 same nature of the algorithm the authors
 Armaanzas et al.
 [21], used the algorithm to 
evaluate the classification accuracy to seek 
the most substantial risk factor and 
establish the initial set of 
substantial risk factors for chronic illness early warning. From the results of the two work
s we can safely 
say that the algorithm has good results and it is suitable to
 be utilized to identify significant accuracy if 
the relationships of the healthcare data are in linear form. 
 3.3.3. Decision Tree Several study have explored the decision
 tree method to analyze clinical data.
 The authors Sharma & 
Om [23]
, Wang et al.
 [24] and Zolbanin 
et al.[25] have used the decision tree algor
ithm in their respective 
work. Having the nature to examine data and make the 
tree and its rules are used to make a prediction. All 
the three work
s have used the decision tree to the data s
et to improve the prognostic performance, in 
terms of accuracy. The nature of the data set used in
 this research are rather 
balanced set of data set. 
From the comparative of the work
s, we conclude that decision tree as cannot be used in proposing prognostic 
decision to solve imbalanced problems because the de
cision tree recursively separate observations into 
branches to construct a tree. 
 3.3.4. Swarm Intelligence
 The authors 
Yeh et al. [26], Fei 2010 [27], and Abdi & Giveki [28]
 have used the swarm intelligence 
method to designed their diagnosis model. The 
algorithm particle swarm optimization (PSO) is able to 
efficiently find the optimal or near optimal solutions
 in large search spaces. All the three authors tried
 to resolve optimzation problem which often involv
es features in the classification problems. The 
classification process will be faster and more accu
rate if less number of features are used. 
From the work 
studied, the PSO based approach proves to improv
e the overall classification resu
lts since PSO is being 
used to select suitable parameters in the involved classifiers. 
 3.3.5. K-Nearest Neighbor
 Authors 
Garca-
Laencina et al. [29], Armaanzas et al.[21], Jen et al.[22
], Bagui et al.[30], and a

et al. [31]
 have used the k
-nearest neighbour in their resp
ective predictive  models. The k
-nearest 
neighbour is an instance based classifier method. The pa
rameter units consists of samples that are used in 
the method and this algorithm then assumes th
at all instances relate to the points in the 
n-dimensional 
space RN. The algorithm is very expedient as the informatio
n in the training data is never lost. However, 
this algorithm would be suitable if 
the training data set is large as this
 algorithm is very time consuming 
when
 each of the sample in training set is processed wh
ile classifying a new data and this process requires 
a longer classification time. From the work by the mentioned authors, the classification accuracy is what 
311 Neesha Jothi et al.  /  Procedia Computer Science   72  ( 2015 )  306  313 
 they would like to attain
 instead of classification time as the classification accuracy
 is more important in 
the medical diagnosis. 
 3.3.6. Logistic Regression 
 Logistic regression (LR) is a method that would use the given set of features either continuos, discrete, 
or a mixture of both types and the binary target, th
e LR then computes a linear combination fo the inputs 
and passes through the logistic function
 [29]. This method is commonly used because 
it is easy to
 implementation and 
it provides competitive results. Authors 
Garca-
Laencina et al. [29], Mamiya et al. 
[32], Su et al. [20], Wang et al.[24], Zolbanin et al.
 [25], Thompson et al. [33], and Samanta et al. [34]
 have adopted the LR in their resp
ective research work. The results obtain
ed from all the authors are not 
very significant, due to the signifiant decrement in the size of the input data sets. 
The results would have 
been more significant if the datasets were large in quan
tity as the boundaries of accuracy would be larger. 
The LR works well for larger datasets. 
 3.3.7. Bayesian Classifier  Authors Armaanzas et al. [
21], and Bandyopadhyay et al.[35]
 have used the Bayesian classifier 
method in their respective predic
tive model. The Bayesian classifiers is well known for its computational 
efficient and ability to handle missing data naturally and eff
iciently. Having this
 advantage both the 
authors have recorded a good prediction accuracy from 
the models  designed respectively. By having the 
models implemented the Bayesian classifier also prov
es that the model is su
itable since the averaging 
approach has led to improved prediction accuracy an
d allows authors to extract more features from the 
data without being overfitting. This method would be
 a good approach if there data sets are suffering 
from missing data. 
 3.3.8. Support Vector 
 The support vector method (SVM) is proven to be 
advantageous in handling classification tasks with 
execellent generalization performance. The method seeks to minimize the upper bound of the 
generalization error based on
 the structural risk minimization principle. The SVM training is equivalent to 
solve a linear constrained quadratic programming problem [36]. The method is very commonly used in 

medic
al diagnosis. Authors 
Garca-
Laencina et al. [29], Zheng et al. [36], Kang et al. [37], and Su et 
al.[20] have used the method in their model in medical diagnose
s. Some of the authors have used the 
SVM method for comparative study purpose. The SVM meth
od generalization ability is controlled by two 
different factors, that is the training error and the ca
pacity of the learning machine measured. The training 
error rate can be controlled by changing the features 
in the classifiers. From the results obtained from the 
studies, it clearly shows that the SVM showed greater 
performance since it maps the features to higher 
dimensional space
  
 From the papers reviewed and discussed, the data mi
ning methods accuracy varies depending on the 
features of
 the data sets and the size of data set betwee
n the training and testing sets. The common 
characteristics among the healthcare
 data sets are highly imbalanced d
ata sets, where by the majority and 
the minority classifier are not balanced
 resulting prediction erroneous
 when run by the classifiers. 
Another characteristics of healthcare data 
sets are the missing values. The sample size
 of the data is often 
seen as another characteristics 
as the data available are usually in small scale. The
re is no one suitable 
data mining method to resolve all this issues.

 Conclusion 
 The data mining has played in an important role in 
healthcare industry, especially in predicting various 
types of diseases. The diagnosis is widely being used
 in predicting diseases, they are extensively used in
 medical diagnosing. In conclusion, there is no one 
data mining method to resolve the issues in the 
healthcare data sets. In order to obtain the highes
t accuracy among classifiers which is important in 
medical diagnosing
 with the characteristics of d
ata being taken care, we need
 to design a hybrid model 
which could resolve the mentioned issues. Our future di
rections is to enhance the predictions using hybrid 
models.
