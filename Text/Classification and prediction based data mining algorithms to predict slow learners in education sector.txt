 Abstract
 Educational Data Mining field concentrate on Prediction more often as compare to generate exact results for future purpose. 
In order to keep a check on the changes occurring in cu
rriculum patterns, a regular analysis is must of educational 
databases. This paper focus on identifying the slow learners among students and displaying it by a
 predictive data mining 
model using classification based algorithms. Real World data set from a high school is taken and filtration of desired 
potential variables is done using WEKA an Open Source Tool. The dataset of student academic records is tested and 
applied on various
 classification algorithms such as Multilayer Perception, Nave Bayes, SMO, J48 and REPTree using 
WEKA
 an Open source tool
. As a result,
 statistics 
are generated based
 on all classification algorithms and comparison of all 
five classifiers is also done in order to predict the accuracy and to find the best performing classification algorithm
 among 
all. In this paper,
 a knowledge flow model is also shown among all five classifiers. This paper showcases the importance of 
Prediction and Classification based data mining algorithms in the field of education and also presents
 some promising 
future lines

  1. Introduction
 Data mining has attracted lot of attention in
 the research industry and in society as a whole in recent years, due 
to enormous availability of large amount
 of data and the need for turning such data into useful information and 
knowledge. Data mining, also called Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD), is the field of discovering 
new and potentially useful information from 
huge databases

Educational Data Mining (EDM) is the application of Data Mining techniques on educational data. The 
objective of EDM is to analyze such data and to resolve educational research issues. EDM deals with 

developing new methods to explore the educational data, and using Data Mining methods to better understand 
student
 learning environment
 [1-4]. The EDM process converts raw data coming from educational systems into 
useful information that could potentially have a great impact on educational research and practice. Educational 
Data Mining researchers study a variety of areas, including individual learning from educational software, 
computer supported collaborative learning ,computer
-adaptive testing (and testing more broadly), and the 
factors that are associated with student failure or non
-retention in courses
[6,8]. Some other key areas include 
improvement of student models; application of EDM methods has been in discovering or improving models of 
a domains knowledge structure and studying pedagogical support (both in learning software, and in other 
domains, such as collaborative learning behaviours). There are increasing research interests in using data 
mining in education. This new emerging field, called educational data mining, concerns with developing 

methods that discover knowledge from data originating from educational environments. Educational data 

mining uses many techniques such as Decision Trees, Neural Networks, Nave Bayes, K
-nearest neighbour
 and 
many others. Prediction and analysis of student performance is an important milestone in educational 
environment. 


[4,5]. Academic 
performance of student is not a result of only one deciding factor besides it heavily hinges on various factors 
like personal, socio
-economic, psychological and other environmental variables. This paper identifies
 the 
factors associated with students whose academic performance is not good and to improve the quality of 
education by identifying slow learners so that teachers can assist them individually to improve their
 performance. Through this paper, the accuracy of some classification techniques for predicting performance of 
a student
 is also investigated. The main
 objectives of this work
 are: to generate  data source of predictive 
variables, Data mining methodologies
 to study student performance at high school level, 
identification of the 
slow learners performance, identification of the highly influencing predictive variables on the academic 
performance of high school students and to find the best classification algorithm

 2. Background and prior work
 Data mining, also called Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD), is the field of discovering novel and 
potentially useful information from large amounts of data. Educational Data Mining (EDM) is still in its 
infancy
 [15]. The field of EDM is new and emerging in the field of education sector which can also be applied 
in other areas like sports, accounts, transportation etc.
 The international working group in EDM established the 
Journal of Educational Data Mining (2009) and a yearly international conference that began in 2008. Han and 
Kamber [17] describes data mining software that allow the users to analyze data from different dimensions, 
Categorize it and summarize the relationships which are identified during the mining process. M.Ramaswami 
and R.Bhaskaran
 [12] applied CHAID prediction model to analyze the interrelation between variables that are 
used to predict the outcome of the performance at higher secondary school education.
 The CHAID prediction 
model of student performance was constructed with seven class predictor variable. Nguyen Thai
-Nghe, Andre 
Busche, and Lars Schmidt
-Thieme [13] used
 machine learning techniques to improve the prediction results of 
502   Parneet Kaur et al.  /  Procedia Computer Science   57  ( 2015 )  500  508 
academic performances in real case studies. Three methods have been used by them to deal with the class 
imbalance problem and all of them show satisfactory results. They first balanced the datasets and used both 

cost
-insensitive and sensitive learning with 
SVM for the small d
atasets with Decision Tree for the larger 
datasets. Arockiam et al. [14] implemented FP Tree and K
-means clustering technique for finding the similarity 
between urban and rural students programming skills. FP Tree mining was
 applied to sieve the patterns from 
the dataset. K
-means clustering was used to determine the programming skills
 of the students. The study clearly 
indicates that the rural and the urban students differ in their programming skills
 and found that huge 
proportions of urban students were
 good in programming skill compared to rural students. It divulges that 
academicians provide extra training to urban students in the programming subject.  Cortez and Silva [15] 
attempted to predict failure in the two core classes (Mathematics and Portuguese) of two secondary school 
students from the Alentejo region of Portugal by utilizing 29 predictive variables. Four data mining algorithms 
such as Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Ne
ural Network (NN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) 
were applied on a data set of 788 students, who appeared in 2006 examination. It was reported that DT and NN 

algorithms had the predictive accuracy of 93% and 91% for two
-class dataset (pass/fail) respectively. It was 
also reported that both DT and NN algorithms had the predictive accuracy of 72% for a four
-class dataset. Galit 
[18] gave a case study that use
s 
 data to analyze their learning behaviour
 to predict the results and to
 warn
 students at risk before their final exams. V.Ramesh et al [16] tries to identify the factors influencing the 
performance of students in final examination. They 
adopted survey cum experimental methodology to generate 
the database. The algorithms which were used by them for implementation were Nave Bayes, Multi Layer 
Perception, SMO, J48, and REPTree. The obtained results from hypothesis testing reveals that type of
 school is 
not influence student performance but 

  2.1 Proposed Methodology
  A survey cum experimental methodology is used. Through extensive search of the literature and discussion 

with experts on student performance, a number of factors that are considered to have influence on the 
performance of a student are identified. These influencing factors are categorized as input variables. For this 

work,
 recent real world data is collected from high school. This data is then filtered out
 using manual 
techniques. Then data is
 transformed into a standard format
 required by the WEKA tool. After that
, features 
and parameters
 selection is identified.

5. Conclusion and Future Scope
 In this paper, classification techniques are used for prediction on the dataset of
 152 students, to predict and 

 as well slow learners among them. In this study, a model was developed based 
on some selected student related input variables collected from real world (high schools). Among all data 
mining classifiers Multi 
Layer 
Perception
 performs best with 75% accuracy and therefore MLP proves to be 
potentially effective and efficient
 classifier algorithm. 
Also comparison of all 5 classifiers with the help of 
WEKA experimenter
 is also done, in this case also MLP proves to be best with F
-measure of 82%. Therefore, 
performance of MLP is relatively higher than other classifiers. A model performance chart is also plotted. This 
research help the
 institution
s to identify students who are slow learners which further provide base for deciding 
special aid to them. EDM is in its infancy and it has lot of potential for education.EDM opens promising and 
exciting
 avenues for future research. In future, Integration of data mining techniques with DBMS and E
- learning techniques
 is merged together on different datasets to find accuracy and predictions of desired results. 
Also, EDM tools are easy to understand and interface
d with various techniques. E
ducators with no expertise in 
data mining
 can also apply their hands in these fields. Also some new factors can be applied to improve the 

 performance, learning and retention
 capabilities among them
. Hence the future of EDM is promising 
for further research and can be applied in other areas like medicine, sports, and share
 market due to the 
availability of huge databases.
