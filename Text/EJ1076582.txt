Abstract 

The use of music and song in the 
English language-learning 
classroom is not new.
 While many teachers 
intuitively feel that music is beneficial in teaching English language, there is sometimes a lack of the theoretical 

underpinnings that support such a choice. There are exam
ples in the literature to argue the strong relationship 
between music and language that are su
bstantiated by research in the fields of cognitive science, anthropology, 
sociolinguistics, psycholinguistics, First Language Ac
quisition (FLA) and Second Language Acquisition (SLA). 
Keywords:
 music, song, English language learning 
1. Introduction 

The use of music and song in the English language-learning classroom is not new. As early as Bartle (1962), 
Richards (1969) or Jolly (1975), scho
lars have been arguing for use of music in a language acquisition context 
for both its linguistic benefits and for the motivati
onal interest it generates in language learners.  
There are examples in the literature to argue the st
rong relationship between music and language that are 
substantiated by research in the fiel
ds of cognitive science, 
anthropology, sociolinguis
tics, psycholinguistics, 
First Language Acquisition (FLA) and Second Language 
Acquisition (SLA). Music had been used on occasion 
with the Audiolingual 
Method in language teaching classrooms to
 reduce the boredom that could occur from 
repetitive drills from the 1950s through to the 1970s (Bartl
e, 1962; Kanel, 2000) and later, the use of classical 
instrumental music was used with the goal to produce 
a relaxed state of mind that makes the brain receptive to 
inputs and activates the subconscious in Suggestopedia methodology (Lozanov, 1978; see also Bancroft, 1978). 

However, it may not have been until Communicative La
nguage Teaching (CLT) and Task Based Learning (TBL) 
approaches became more pervasive that there was a sudd
en demand for pedagogical material for the use of songs 
in the language-learning classroom (Griffee, 2010).  
1.1 Why is it Important? 

There were two important outcomes from the author's recent
 research (2010) into effective use of music in the 
English language classroom (in press). One suggested that
 there was strong support for use of music in the 
language-learning classroom, but that there was actually very little occurring in most classrooms. Connected, but 

a separate issue, implied that while many teachers intu
itively felt music was beneficial in teaching English 
language, there was also the perception that there was a lack of understanding of the theoretical underpinnings 

that supported such a choice. Theref
ore, some educators felt unable to defend the decision to champion use of 
music in the classroom to administrators, business English students or those in a predominantly exam focused 
environment.  
Salcedo (2010), after a survey of foreign language teach
ing journals, suggests there are only a few articles on 
the subject compared to multitudinous articles on other me
thodological ideas. Other scholars have noted this as 
well: Coe (1972) stated there have been no controlled 
music use in the language classroom experiments and 
Griffee (1989), in an editor
ial introduction discussing why songs and music arent used more extensively in the 
language classroom, suggests there exists a lack of theo
retical perspective and empiri
cally based research in the 
field. I would propose that, while there has been some progress in this subfield, little has changed throughout the 
past decades.

 1.2 Subsections of Literature Review 
In this literature review, I will exam
ine academic perspectives from within the field of applied linguistics and 
will make connections to the field from other disciplines that argue there is a firm empirical, theoretical and 

pedagogical basis to consider for the use of music as an aid in language acquisition. The examination of the 
literature will consider the following five categories:  
1. Sociological Considerations 
2. Cognitive Science 
3. First Language Acquisition 
4. Second Language Acquisition 
5. Practical Pedagogical Resources 
2. Sociological Considerations 
There are four distinct sections in 
the exploration of Sociological Considerations that will be discussed. Those 
include the areas of Anthropological Arguments, Community, Breaking Boundaries and Culture. 
2.1 Anthropological Arguments 

The connection of song to both the development of human languages and the linguistic development of the 
individual are anthropologically worth noting (Murphey, 1990). Livingstone (1973), in a contentious article that 

made extrapolations from physical anthropological research of birdsong and mammal behaviour, hypothesised 

that humans evolved song before speech. While this can never conclusively be proven (see Count, Hewes, 

Livingstone & Mourant, 1974 for counter-argument), it raises interesting connections to infant development and 

first language acquisition research that will be discusse
d later in this review. From a social anthropological 
perspective, Merriam (1964) has argued that the survival 
of literature, epic poetry and ballads in oral traditions 
must be credited to the use of song. The odes of praise and stories of the tribe were passed on through song so 

that the texts would not be forgotten before the written word developed. Rubin (1995) suggests this may be 

because of the multilayered patterns of rhythm, sound, 
linguistic meaning and emo
tional content functioning 
simultaneously. Lastly, drawing on anthropological and ethnomusicological literature, Trehub and Trainor (1998) 

examine the historical and cultural functions of songs in 
child care, claiming the de
scriptive evidence seems to 
suggest that the practice of singing to infants and many
 details of song form and style are rooted in ancient 
traditions that have survived industrialization and urbanization (43). It does appear the anthropological 
development of human languages is, to some extent, connected to music and song. 
2.2 Community 
In addition to being utilized by caregivers and individu
al storytellers in oral traditions, singing has also 
historically evolved as a collective activity. It is communally practiced by people not requiring professional 

training, with a wide range of experience levels, and in a variety of settings including leisure, religious or 

educational communities. It is argued that use of song in
 the language classroom enhances social harmony (Huy 
Le, 1999), creates a safe space to experience learning 
collectively and contributes to the building of a community 
(Lems, 1996; Lake, 2003); all of which 
are essential factors for 
effectively attaining teach
ing and learning goals. 
Specifically examining trust and cooperation, Anshel and Kipper (1988) suggest that group participation in 

singing positively influences both trust and cooperation, 
which are primary contributors to the progression of 
group cohesion and a sense of community (see McMillan & 
Chavis, 1986 for further discussion of theories of 
community). Gao (2008), while discussing use of karaoke and singing contests as evidence of learner 

collaboration in English Corners in China, approaches the humanistic learning that can occur within this type of 

community as following traditional Chinese cultural values and Confucian pedagogical traditions (see also 

Nguyen, Terlouw & Pilot, 2006). The literature appears to
 suggest that the specific feeling of belonging to a 
cohesive community, that many teachers explicitly strive to
 establish for their learners
 in the classroom, can be 
promoted by use of musi
c and collective singing. 
2.3 Breaking Boundaries 
Music consistently surrounds our lives and may potentially 
assist educators in removi
ng boundaries between the 
various communities that students belong to (Nagy & Herman, 1987). Extending their work, Medina (1990) 

suggests it may be beneficial to attempt methods that more closely resemble life outside of the institutional 

classroom, which is generally filled with music, songs, 
stories and visual images. B
ecause students learn a great 
deal of language before school age and outside of the institution once school has begun, it is potentially 
justifiable to consider non-traditional teaching methods that are less structured and ritualised.  
www.ccsenet.org/elt English Language Teaching Vol. 6, No. 2; 2013 
115 
 Cheung (2001) prefers th
e image of music bridging gaps between for
mal and informal learning as opposed to 
breaking boundaries and Huy Le (1999) extends this bridging of formal and informal learning environments to 

include the bridging of the gap between teachers and st
udents as well. By breaki
ng down the boundaries or 
bridging the gaps between stereotypical institutional learning and the informal learning of our homes, work 

places and school grounds, we can contin
ue to engage students in natural a
nd authentic language that they will 
want to practice independently out of class (Jenkins & Dixon, 1983; Harwood, 1998). In a study of young 

learners engagement in music beyond the institutional cl
assroom, Campbell (1998) discusses how the function 
of music in learners lives, the use of music in play an
d the manner of musical encultu
ration relate to the place of 
music in institutional educational settings, suggesting more music should occur in educational institutions  

supporting Murpheys (1992a) argument that the school environment is the only place in society not using music 
and song to its full potential.  
2.4 Culture 
Candlin, in the preface as series editor that 
Songs in Action
 (Griffee, 1992) was a part of, argues for the 
importance songs may provide as an historical and social cultural context to the language being acquired. He 
states: To be sure, songs have a place in the classroom for helping create that friendly and co-operative atmosphere so 
important for language learning, but they can offer much more. They offer insights into the culture and 

especially the stories and myths of different societies, providing a window into the frames of reference and values 
of the peoples whose language we are learning. (Candlin, 1992: ix) 
There are two areas to consider under 
the heading of culture. First, that
 Pop Culture is a global phenomenon 
orientated toward a common youth culture with pop 
songs as its backbone (Gri
ffee, 1992) and hence is 
something that is both significant and familiar to the students (Dubin, 1975). Therefore, use of music from Pop 

Culture allows a window to the target language of the
ir culture (Cheung, 2001; Plagwitz, 2006) and not only 
works to bridge the gap between generations, between pre-defined teacher-student roles and between the 

stereotypical formal and informal lear
ning environments, but also validates and empowers their music, their 
language and their culture (Hamblin, 1987; Domoney & Harris, 1993).  
Secondly, songs are a potentially culturally rich resource 
for the language classroom (Murphey, 1992b; Ajibade 
& Ndububa, 2008) that can 
explicitly be used to teach the cultural 
norms and ideals of the target language 
(Gravenall, 1945; Jolly, 1975). Music, while universal, is 
culturally specific in that th
e musical content and style 
mirror a particular culture, acting as a 
cultural artefact that may both reflect 
and influence that culture (Griffee, 
1992; Failoni, 1993; Mishan, 2005). The introduction of vocal music as the foundation on which to either build 

a coordinated language-culture course or, more often, supplement an already established program, can be a 

powerful tool, especially when the music is a faithful 
reflection of the culture from which it derives (Jones, 
2008: 10). While a number of academics agree and appear 
to support the pedagogical use of music to increase 
cultural competency in the culture of the target language (i.e. Saricoban & Metin, 2000; Orlova, 2003), there are 

other linguists such as Huy Le (1999) who argues that music, particularly songs, is an encoding of cultural 

values and ideology which needs to be viewed critica
lly if foreign music is used in teaching a second 
language The use of music in the classroom raises significant questions concerning how culture, language 

and identity are related, and therefore demands critical refl
ective thought, if not a level of caution regarding the 
potential linguistic and cultural imperialism that could 
occur (see Pennycook 2003, 2007 for further discussion 
of transcultural flows and performativity with relationship to culture and identity).   
We now move from the discussion of Sociological Considerations into the exploration of the cognitive and 
neural relationship of language and music. 
3. Cognitive Science 
Cognitive research investigates the anatomic structure of the brain and its neural functions, suggesting that 
language and music have im
portant points of convergence and/or overl
ap. There are multiple recent studies in 
this field, likely somewhat due to the increase in soph
istication of neuroscience technology as well as increased 
interest from within the field in the neural and functional structure of both language and music domains (for 

developmental comparison, see McMullen & Saffran, 2004). Additionally, the popularisation of some studies 

such as the Mozart Effect (Rauscher, Shaw & Ky 1993, 1995; Hetland, 2000) by Campbell (1997) has brought 

increased attention from the general public to the field of
 cognitive science. The original Rauscher et al. (1993, 
1995) study extended the work of French therapist Tomatis (Thompson & Andrews, 2000) and indicated an 

enhancement of spatial-temporal abilities after listening 
to music composed by Mozart, an assertion that has 
been disputed by Chabris (1999), Nantais and Schellenberg (1999), Steele, Bass and Crook (1999) and Steele et 
www.ccsenet.org/elt English Language Teaching Vol. 6, No. 2; 2013 
116 
 al. (1999). 
Cognitive science research agrees that there are 
important connections between music and language: 
Like language, music is a human universal involving perceptu
ally discrete elements organized into hierarchically 
structured sequences. Music and language can thus serve as foils for each other in the study of brain 

mechanisms underlying complex sound processing, and comparative research can provide novel insights into the 
functional and neural architecture of both domains. (Patel, 2003: 674) 
There is, however, an interesting contradiction noted in
 the literature debating how that occurs. The evidence 
from neuropsychology argues that musical and linguistic elements can be dissociated, and therefore may work 

together as discrete domains. Borchgrevink (1982) postu
lated that linguistic and musi
cal elements are processed 
in different hemispheres of the brain and therefore language and music used concurrently provides effective 

pedagogical methodology to increase learning, while Jackendoff (1991, 2006) describes how music parallels the 

perception of language and suggests a parallel architecture approach. It is argued that language and music 

collaborate but operate in different domains, so that f
rom a conceptual standpoint, music and language must be 
dissociated, or else there would be no possibility for cooperation (Steinke, Cuddy & Holden, 1997: 316). A 

specific study of song lyrics and melody processing sugges
t that the monitoring of speech and music in songs is 
performed by independent neural processors (Peretz, 2002: 174) and a research study of how phonemes and 

pitch are controlled in different but collaborating areas 
corroborate those findings 
that the two aspects of 
language are handled separately, yet in harmony by a musical-linguistic collaboration (Zatorre, Meyer, Gjedde 
& Evans, 1996: 848). 
Yet these conclusions stand in direct contrast to recent neuroimaging data, which indicates a convergence in the 
processing of the syntactic relations in language and musi
c (Patel, 2003). This suggests that musical structure is 
processed in language areas of the brain (Patel, Edward, Ratner, Besson & Holcomb, 1998; Koelsch, Gunter & 

Friederici, 2000; Koelsch et al., 2002
), specifically localized in Broc
as area and its right-hemisphere 
homologue, in areas involved in syntactic analysis during auditory language comprehension indicating that 

these regions process syntactic information that is less
 language-specific than previously believed (Maess, 
Koelsch, Gunter & Friederici, 2001: 5
40; also see Levitin & Menon, 2003). Hence, because they are processed 
in the same region, our brains may r
ecognise aspects of linguistic and musi
cal sequences in a similar manner.  
Patel (2003) and Slevc, Rosenberg and Patel (2008) suggest a possible resolution to this contradiction in the 
literature with the use of linguistic and musical syntactic processing cognitive theories, postulating a specific 

point of convergence between these theories leads to th
e hypothesis that syntax in
 language and music share a 
common set of processes (instantiated in front brain areas) that operate on different structural representations (in 
posterior brain areas)
 (Patel, 2003: 674). 
As we move from the area of Cognitive Science to that of
 First Language Acquisition, Gomez and Gerken (2000) 
act as a transition in their literature review of cogn
itive research discussing the possible contributions and 
correlations of the language acquisition device (LAD
) and associative learning functions through the 
methodology of testing artificial language learning and 
language acquisition in infa
nts. The studies reviewed 
raise significant questions with respect 
to whether such neural functions are general or specific to language. The 
fine-grained characterizations of infant learning mechanisms that this approach permits should result in a better 

understanding of the relative contributions of, and the dynamic between, innate and learned factors in language 
acquisition (
ibid
: 178). 
4. First Language Acquisition  
The FLA field offers a number of insights that corroborate the arguments of Cognitive Neuroscience for the 
innate connection of language and music in human beings. Loewy (1995) postulates that music acts as the 

prelinguistic carrier for communicative intent, essentially 
that a foundation for peer social interaction is built 
through the infant's preverbal communication of crying. Other scholars, such as Chen-Hafteck (1997), suggest 

that the prelinguistic phase discussed in FLA literature is similar to the premusical phase discussed by 

musicologists, which echoes arguments that song-like 
vocalisation will commonly precede language in regular 
ontogenetic development (Murphey, 1989). 
Music and language are the two ways that humans communicate and express themselves through sound. Since 
birth, babies start to listen and produce sound without distinguishing between music and language, singing and 
speech. (Chen-Hafteck, 1997: 85) 
The intentional experimentation with linguistic production occurs through prosodic elements of speech and the 
vocal contour, including manipulating tone, timbre, stress and rhythm in the infants indistinct babbling 
www.ccsenet.org/elt English Language Teaching Vol. 6, No. 2; 2013 
117 
 vocalisation that precedes specific linguistic and musical
 production. "This music of speech is the earliest 
dimension of language that is used and understood by children (Loewy, 1995: 61). Papousek and Papousek 

(1981, 1991) support Loewys proposition and argue ther
e is very little difference between spoken intonational 
contour and sung melodic contour before the first lexical items are acquired by infants, which is corroborated by 

empirical research (Trehub, Trainor 
& Unyk, 1993) that tracked language development in infants by analysing 
pitch contours in linguistic and musical material.  
It is argued the input infants receive in affective baby-
talk or infant-directed speec
h prosody (Trainor, Austin & 
Desjardins, 2000), as well as the songs mothers and ot
her caregivers sing (Bergeson & Trehub, 2002), has an 
impact of linguistic and musical development. Nursery rh
ymes and lullabies are some of the first language input 
that occurs with enough repetition to encourage memo
rization and therefore acquis
ition (Howle, 1989). Murphey 
and Alber (1985) note that as children grow up, they re
ceive less and less of the affective musical motherese 
language that caregivers use with in
fants and postulate it is replaced by pop music as the motherese of 
adolescents, as well as suggest connections between the 
motherese of adolescents and the benefits of affective 
foreigner talk (see also Murphey, 1992a). This affective 
foreigner talk is observed in language teachers as a 
simplified code of comprehensible input at the appropriate language level in the language-learning classroom, 

noting that the use of modified intonation is often in
stinctive from both language teachers and caregivers, who 
are often unaware that they are singing with an exaggerated pronunciation and hyperbolic melodic contour at 

that moment (Fonseca Mora, 2000). It 
appears that melodic musicality of sp
eech is not only significant to FLA, 
but to the entire language acquisition process and connections can be drawn between first language and second 
language acquisition literature as we move into the next section. 
5. Second Language Acquisition  
For the purposes of this literature review, the extensive 
field of SLA research as it applies to use of music in 
language-learning will be discussed under the headings: Af
fective Filters, Motivation, Learning Strategies and 
Empirical SLA Studies. 
5.1 Affective Filters 
The affective filter hypothesis (Krashen
, 1982) argues that the most favourable learning occurs in a setting of 
low anxiety, self-confidence and high motivation. Built on
 SLA research, the hypothesis states acquirers with a 
low affective filter seek and receive mo
re input, interact with
 confidence, and are more
 receptive to the input 
they receive (Richards & Rodgers, 2008: 183). An explor
ation of the literature rega
rding how affective filters 
may relate to the use of music and song in the language
 classroom (Merriam, 1964; 
Coe, 1972; Claerr & Gargan, 
1984; Wilcox, 1995) suggests that music lowers affective 
barriers and assists in making students more relaxed, 
thereby more receptive to language learning. Based on
 corpus analysis, pop songs are conversation-like, 
repetitive and occur at roughly half the speed of spoken 
discourse (Murphey, 1992b), 
therefore also lowering 
affective barriers. This simplicity, their highly affective 
and dialogic features, and their vague references (ghost 
discourse), allow listeners to use th
em in personally associative ways (Murphey, 1992b: 771). Connecting this 
argument to earlier motherese of adolescents discussions
, it is postulated pop songs create a low affective filter 
and Murphey characterises them as a teddy-bear-in-the-e
ar because of their riskless nature. Additional research 
examining differences in affective filter, stress levels 
and language acquisition (Ganschow et al, 1994) implies 
the anomie language-learners feel, which may include a sense of homelessness, social uncertainty and 
dissatisfaction, can be addressed by use of music in the classroom (Schoepp, 2001; Lake, 2003).  
5.2 Motivation 

Motivation is multifaceted and concerns 
both the affective states and attitudes 
that impact the amount of effort a 
learner expends to acquire a new language. The degrees of the various types of instrumental, integrative, 

resultative and intrinsic motivation (Ellis, 1997) differ with
 the individual student and the literature supports the 
use of song and linguistic play in the language classroom (Cook, 1997) to increase individual language-learner 
motivation (see also Ndububa & Ajibade, 2006; King, 2010).  
The validity of using authentic and natural language input including real-world/target tasks, pedagogical tasks 
and enabling skills (Nunan, 2004: 19) so that there is some sort of relationship to comparable real-world 

activities (Skehan, 1998: 95) has been noted as a motiva
ting factor in the language classroom (see also Nunan, 
1989; Bell & Gower, 1998; McGrath, 2002). Mishan (2005) contends that because music is an authentic activity 

that occurs among first language users both in terms of discussion of popular music as well as in the group 

singing that occurs at many public events ranging from karaoke to football, it also proves motivating to use for 

language-learners in a classroom setting (see also Cook, 
1997). The arguments that the rhythmic patterns of Jazz 
Chant are fragments of authentic language use (Graham,
 1992); that popular rock music provides meaningful 
www.ccsenet.org/elt English Language Teaching Vol. 6, No. 2; 2013 
118 
 authentic activity with frequent integrated exposure (D
omoney & Harris, 1993); that rock songs are short, 
accessible authentic texts rich in conten
t that work as a catalyst to engage with and build meaning from (Pope, 
1995); that the poetry of rock music provides a valid auth
entic text (Abrate, 1983; Gr
iffee, 1992); and that this 
rock poetry may be considered an example of inclus
ive literature (Ferradas Moi, 1994, 2003), all provide 
further support to the motivating factor of music in the language classroom. 
5.3 Learning Strategies 
It has been suggested that motivation may have connections to other individual learner differences in second 
language acquisition such as learner strategies, learner autonomy and preferred learning styles (Sinclair, 1996; 

Cohen, 1998; Benson, 2006). Separating potential interconnectivity of the variables between motivations, 

individual learning preferences due to multiple intelligence
s and learner strategies (Carrell, Pharis & Liberto, 
1989; Brown, 2007) therefore becomes an issue. There is 
also a strong possibility that the influence of learning 
environments, which may include family, educational and cultural background factors might have an effect on 

the learner (Locastro, 1994; Harley, 2000). Gardner (1999) acknowledges Locastros point when considering the 

impact of personal decisions in the expression of multiple intelligences (Chen & Gardner, 2005) and defines 

intelligence as a biopsychological potential to process in
formation that can be activated in a cultural setting to 
solve problems or cr
eate products that are of value in a cultu
re (Gardner, 1999: 33
). Fonseca Mora (2000) 
applies Gardners multiple intelligences
 hypothesis specifically to langua
ge teaching (see also Berman, 1998) 
and asserts one of the main implications for teaching of 
this theory was that students should not only be taught 
to increase their verbal, spatial, and numerical intelligences, but also to nurture their musical, bodily-kinaesthetic, 
interpersonal, and intrapersonal intelligences (146).  
Although there are, admittedly, some ch
allenges with the learner strategy literature in general, there are a number 
of researchers who remain enthusiastic about the value 
of language learner strategies (Oxford, 1990; Naiman, 
Frohlich, Stern & Todesco, 1996; Chamot, 2005), suggesting that a more genuine interaction occurs (Lam & 

Wong, 2000). When music is situated as an aid to learning strategies in the language classroom, both cognitive 

and metacognitive strategies are enhanced (Jones, 2008), 
affective exploration is in
creased (Cullen, 1998) and 
the student is more receptiv
e to language inputs (Bancroft, 1978; Lo
zanov, 1978; Magaha
y-Johnson, 1984).  
This leads us now to specific empirical research regard
ing the use of music and its effect on second language 
acquisition. 
5.4 Empirical SLA Studies 
There is ample empirical evidence to
 suggest that use of music and song
 enhances students success in second 
language acquisition, which will be discussed in three 
sections: Recall and Memory, 
The Din/Involuntary Mental 
Rehearsal and Language Specific Skills. Medina claims the conclusions for the use of music in the second 

language classroom are clear. Since music can be as viab
le a vehicle for second language acquisition as stories, 
then songs should not be treated as 
extra-curricular en
tities (1990: 18).  
5.4.1 Recall and Memory 
Empirical research comparing conventional pedagogical methods with those that use music and song has 
produced positive results in the area of vocabulary recall.
 For example, studies with 
primary students by Medina 
(1990) investigated effectiveness of
 vocabulary acquisition with the use of music and story illustrations, and a 
study by Schunk (1999) examined the effect of signing when coupled with singing on receptive vocabulary 
skills. 
Based on research using background music to aid verbal
 phrase recall, Fonseca Mora (2000) asserts that songs 
have a positive outcome on the students language acquisition and that lexical patterns stored in long-term 

musical memory can be retrieved with ease at a later da
te for mental rehearsal, memorisation or during oral 
interaction. Wilcox (1995) studied the pronunciation of ta
rget vocabulary in adult learners through use of music 
cues to aid prosodic memory, which is confirmed by re
search into vocabulary reca
ll attached to visual or 
auditory cues (Brown & Perry, 1991), and research into music-dependent memory using background musical 

cues with specific target vocabulary (Balch, Bowman 
& Mohler, 1992). Brutten, Angelis and Perkins (1985) 
explored this research further by te
sting oral proficiency using musical ab
ility and memory in English language 
learners and suggested that innate musical abilities and verbal memory may have accounted for score variances.  
Pop songs are useful for not only discrete lexical voca
bulary item recall, but also for longer utterances and 
formulaic phrases. For example, Wray and Perkins (2000) 
have suggested that most speech is the repetition and 
variation of memorized formulas, and 
that these formulaic lexical phrases 
are flexible and therefore allow for 
many repetitions. Distinctive intonation, rhythmic and 
stress patterns can accompany each formulaic unit when 
www.ccsenet.org/elt English Language Teaching Vol. 6, No. 2; 2013 
119 
 incorporating the multiple formulaic lexical phrases found in songs, making it easier for the learner to remember 
and apply.  
The use of rhythm and rhyme to assist auditory recall has also been studied, and the multimodal combination of 
rhythm, melody and rhyme along with linguistic prosody appears to lead to greater retention (Graham, 1992; 

Palmer & Kelly, 1992). This has been applied to languag
e learning in a study of rhyming ability of preschool 
children as a phonological skill (Bryant, MacLean, Bradle
y & Crossland, 1990) and applied to English verse 
(Kelly & Rubin, 1988), where connections are sugges
ted between childrens verse and acquisition of prosodic 
rules (see also Krumhansl, 2000 for further psycholinguistic research in this area).  
5.4.2 The Din / Involuntary Mental Rehearsal 
Murphey (1989) provides 
potential evidence rega
rding why music effectively assist
s in lexical and phrasal recall 
in noting the resemblance of songs to conversational discou
rse and suggests they are linguistically processed in a 
similar manner. Thus, song may be called pseudo-dialogal or a form of Piagets (1923) egocentric language, a 

form of egocentric language that at first may be pronounced for us but is soon appropriated by us, 

psychologically and subvocally if not actually sung aloud (Murphey, 1989: 168). He subsequently goes on to 

hypothesize a relationship between Piagets (1923) egocentric speech, Krashens (1983) involuntary verbal 

rehearsal, Vygotskys (1934) inner speech and postul
ates the song-stuck-in-m
y-head (SSIMH) phenomena. 
The similarity of the Din to the SSIMH phenomenon is suggested It is hypothesized that song may act as a 

LAD activator, or be a strategy of the LAD in the onto
genetic development of language (Murphey, 1990: 53). 
The argument for subvocal involuntary mental rehearsal is
 corroborated as potential evidence why songs in the 
language classroom have such a positive effect on dela
yed vocabulary, formulaic lexical phrases and extended 
text recall (Fonseca Mora, 2000; Salcedo, 2010). 5.4.3 Language Specific Skills 
SLA research has also examined specific language skills th
at can be effectively developed with the use of music 
and song, such as explicit development of listening discrimination and comprehension. This has been examined 

for improving aural comprehension and spelling through use of modified cloze procedure (Froehlich, 1985); in a 

comparative study of conventional listening exercises an
d pop song gap-fill exercises (Kanel, 1997); through the 
use of music with passage correction tests (Odlin, 1986); 
and as practice for extracting meaning from noise with 
the mondegreens found in pop music (Smith, 2003). Music in the language classroom may also be utilized with 

an explicit vocabulary and grammar focus (Richards, 1969; Saricoban & Metin, 2000) and used to reinforce 

either grammar or pronunciation points (Allen & Vallette, 1977). Pronunciation and phonology are a natural use 
of songs in the aid of second language acquisition (Schn et al, 2008), and Leith (1979) states: 
there is probably not a better nor quicker way to teach 
phonetics than with
 songs. Phonetics instruction is one 
good use to which songs can be put even in beginning classes (540).  
The repetitive nature of songs makes them effective use 
for pronunciation drills (Bartle, 1962; Techmeier, 1969; 
Shaw, 1970) and lastly, it is argued that songs contextu
ally introduce supra-segmen
tal features (Lems, 2001; 
Wong and Perrachione, 2006), which aids in the learning of patterns for word identification.  
6. Practical Pedagogical Resources 
In the examination of the academic literature, we have 
seen a strong empirical and theoretical basis for the 
potential music has as an aid to language acquisition. Howe
ver, there appears to be a dearth of current literature 
that discusses the extent to which teachers are using musi
c and the manner in which it is being used in a practical 
context. Of the little research explor
ing teacher attitudes and practice that does exist, it seems to focus on 
primary school age children and rarely discusses the use of mu
sic and song with teen or adult learners. In the last 
category of the literature review, a brief survey, which 
does not claim to be exhaustive, of recent textbook 
publications and website journal articles may give some 
indication as to how music is being applied and what 
principles are being recommended in this representative sample.  
There are a number of web resources for use of music in th
e language classroom, including examples of practical 
lesson discussions with theoretical support in online journals such as the 
Internet TESL Journal
 or 
Humanising 
Language Teaching Magazine
. Examples include the use of music while writing to develop critical thinking 
(Aloha, 2005); use of music in language play (Cakir, 1999; Saricoban & Metin, 2000); use of music in 

conversation classes (Orlova, 2003); and use of song lyric word clouds as corpora for the language classroom 

(Kryszewska, 2010). There are also quite a few exampl
es of downloadable lessons and worksheets from various 
websites, the majority of which focus on grammatical or
 vocabulary activities, but few, if any, include any 
rationale or theoretical basis for decisions made in the development of the materials.  
www.ccsenet.org/elt English Language Teaching Vol. 6, No. 2; 2013 
120  Of the teacher resource books published since 2000, there 
is a focus on young learners, such as the Paterson and 
Willis (2008) 
English Through Music
 from the 
Oxford basics for children series
, which includes 36 varied 
practical activities with a theoretical discussion of ra
tionale for music use, what opportunities there are for 
language learning and improving the musical quality of classroom singing. There are also approaches that 

replace the original words of familiar folk, pop or ch
ildrens song melodies in order to learn phonics and 
grammatical concepts. For example, the melody of 
Frre Jacques
 is used with different words so that it becomes 
Talking and Walking
, with a focus on the spelling rules of 
long vowels and silent vowels in the 
Sing Your Way 
Through the Phonics
 program (Gifford, 2000); 
Rock Talk
 (Redding, 2006) explores basic grammar and phonics 
through rock melodies; and, in an effort to learn phonics and grammatical rules, the 
Learning English Through 
Songs
 and 
Phonics the Fun Way
 programs (Gabriel, 2007, 2010) use familiar childrens songs such as 
Twinkle, 
Twinkle Little Star
 and replaces the words to become the 
Grammar Rules Song 
or a song to learn 
Prepositions 
with Rhyming Words using structure There are
. There are also products that specialise in writing songs 
explicitly for the language learning market such as the 
Tutortunes
 grammatically focused pop Top-40-style 
song, Next to Me
 (Lock, 2009), which includes 54 different prepositions, or the 
Days of the Week
 (Mol, 2008) 
from 
Supasongs
, presumably both modelled to some degree on earlier language and music resources such as the 
grammar-orientated 
Hard to Learn that English as a Second Language Blues
 (Wellman & Byrd, 1975).  
There were a number of resource books about music use in the language classroom published in 1992 or 
immediately after, including Graham
 (1992), who created the concept of
 Jazz Chants, the rhythmic unison 
speaking of chants and poetry in the language classroom. Cranmer and Laroy (1992), Griffee (1992) and 

Murphey (1992) were also all published in the same year as part of different publishers established resource 

book series. Central to the Cranmer and Laroy (1992) text, 
which focuses on the use of 
Western orchestral music, 
is the technique of inner eye visualization, of the ability to form images in the mind in response to a musical 

stimulus (
ibid
: 2). The Griffee (1992) text also explores th
e affective response to music in a variety of 
approaches from dictations to listening exercises to music surveys and a number of extension activities along 

with firm theoretical underpinning to the choices made, noting that songs create their own world of feeling and 

emotion, and as we participate in the song, we participate in the world it creates (
ibid
: 4). Lastly, Murpheys 
(1992) text explores music and video, learner autonomy and a variety of authentic language activities that occur 

in first language discourse. Although first published in 1976, Grenough (1994) later republished and includes 

sheet music, lyrics, worksheet questions and visuals with
 additional information. If continuously published and 
therefore current in its song choices, it could prove to be a valuable resource, but by naming and working with 

specific pop songs, the text has a dated feel that the Grif
fee and Murphey texts do not. Unfortunately, out of all 
the texts mentioned in the last paragraph, 
Music and Song
 (Murphey, 1992) is the only one still in print at this 
time, which clearly limits the options for language 
teachers wanting to use music in the classroom.  
7. Conclusion 
One is left with a number of questions based on the lite
rature review of theoretical, empirical and practical 
classroom resources just completed. If connections betw
een music and language are as strong as the literature 
reviewed above suggests, why is there such disparity betw
een theoretical support and pr
actical application in the 
classroom? Why, outside of a few young
 learner texts, has there been such 
a gap in teacher pedagogical resource 
books supporting the use of music in language learning since the early 1990s? Why are the needs of adult and 
teen learners not reflected in the curren
t web or print pedagogical resources?  
7.1 Further Research 
Given the limitations of the authors original study, there appears to be a need for additional research of a similar 
nature examining teacher attitudes and practices
 with a larger sample size in order to increase statistical 
significance. Furthermore, several interesting questions arising from the study point to a need for further research. 

There is a need for an in-depth study with a class of teen and adult learners to measure effects of a music 

intensive teaching methodology versus
 conventional methodologies. There is
 also a need to establish, by 
conducting research on subjects of various age levels, 
whether the influence of music is greater at any one 
particular developmental period. Additionally, further ex
ploration of teacher attitudes and prejudices pertaining 
to Hip-Hop and rap, making connections to World Englishes and identity, is in order. Lastly, little has been done 

in the subvocal involuntary mental rehearsal of the Song-Stuck-In-My-Head-Phenomenon (Murphey, 1990) and 

the motherese of adolescence (Murphey & Alber, 1985; Murphey, 1992a) since first published, although both 
are still viable concepts and re
searchable (Murphey, 2010).  
7.2 Pedagogical Implications 
A number of practical suggestions made by respondents during the course of the authors study point to ways 
www.ccsenet.org/elt English Language Teaching Vol. 6, No. 2; 2013 
121  that a possible disconnect between t
eacher theoretical support and classr
oom use can be bridged. Numerous 
respondents requested materials development as a resour
ce for use of music by language teachers. Of the many 
useful music books aimed at English 
language teachers of adult and teen st
udents published in the 1990s, only 
the Murphey (1992) is still available. 
Therefore, the suggestion from many 
respondents to publish new materials 
may be valid.  Potential suggestions include (1) a journal aimed specifically at uses of music in language 

teaching, with opportu
nity for feedback and conferences (2); a 
practical resource book with ready-made 
photocopiable lesson plans and worksheets (3); and lastly, an edited collection of music in language-learning 

journal articles so that teachers and 
future researchers can easily access the 
growing body of published research 
in this subfield. This literature review is
 an attempt to address the last point. 
7.3 Closing 
Overall, the results are clear in suggesting use of musi
c and song in the language-learning classroom is both 
supported theoretically by practicing teachers and grounde
d in the empirical literature as a benefit to increase 
linguistic, sociocultural and communicative competencies. From an educational standpoint, music and language 
not only can, but should be studied together.
