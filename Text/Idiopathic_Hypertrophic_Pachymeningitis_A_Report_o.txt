Hypertrophic pachymeningitis is a rare disorder characterizedby marked inflammatory hypertrophy of the dura mater, withsubsequent neurological deficits resulting from the compressionof adjacent structures. Based on anatomic site, cases ofhypertrophic pachymeningitis can be subdivided into spinal,intracranial and the much less frequent craniospinalpachymeningitis.1-3Hypertrophic pachymeningitis involving the spinal meningeswas first described in the nineteenth century by Charcot andJoffroy and the intracranial form was reported shortly thereafter(cited in Ashkenazi et al4and Parney et al5). HypertrophicABSTRACT:Purpose:We report the treatment and follow-up, including MRI, of two patients with idiopathic hypertrophicpachymeningitis and review the English language literature, with emphasis on management and outcome in this rare disorder.Methodsand Materials:The files of two patients were reviewed, with relevant histopathology and imaging (MRI). The first patient has beenfollowed for sixteen years (the longest MRI-documented postoperative course reported for this condition) and the second for two years.The English language literature was reviewed, including a summary of all reported patients that have been followed with MRI or CTimaging. Results:Despite extensive investigation, no underlying etiology was determined in either patient. Histopathological studiesrevealed a chronic inflammatory dural infiltrate in both patients, with granulomas in the first but not the second patient. The first patientunderwent surgery twice and has remained stable for sixteen years, despite persistent neurologic deficits. The second patient wasmanaged with dexamethasone after a surgical biopsy, and experienced complete resolution of all neurological deficits and abnormalitiesseen with MRI. Conclusions:Although prompt and extensive surgery has been recommended for this condition, the results from oursecond patient indicate that complete remission can be achieved in some patients with biopsy and steroid therapy.This also supports theview that autoimmune mechanisms underlie idiopathic hypertrophic pachymeningitis. The first patient illustrates that extensivelaminectomies may be an effective therapeutic option but chronic discomfort may result. If extensive surgery must be performed,laminoplasty should be done because of the potential for reduced pain and improved long-term spinal stability.RSUM: Pachymningite hypertrophique idiopathique:  propos de deux cas et revue de la littrature.But: Nous rapportons le traitement etle suivi, incluant la RMN, de deux patients ayant prsent une pachymningite hypertrophique idiopathique et nous revoyons la littrature de langueanglaise en insistant sur le traitement et lvolution de cette maladie rare.

Ceci est en faveur de lhypothse dun mcanisme autoimmun dans la pachymningite hypertrophique idiopathique. Le premier casillustre que les laminectomies extensives peuvent tre une option thrapeutique efficace, mais quun inconfort chronique peut sen suivre. Si unechirurgie extensive doit tre effectue, une laminoplastie devrait tre faite pour minimiser la douleur et assurer une meilleure stabilit de la colonnevertbrale  long terme.Can. J. Neurol.

Most recent cases, however,have been reported as idiopathic, despite intensive investigationto implicate other etiologies. The widespread application ofgadolinium enhanced MRI has facilitated the diagnosis andfollow-up of patients and increased the frequency of reportedcases.6-8We present two cases of idiopathic hypertrophicpachymeningitis; one of craniospinal and the second of spinaldistribution, with MRI findings, pathology, and postoperativefollow-up. These patients illustrate very different approaches totreatment. The first patient underwent surgery twice, initially forbiopsy and subsequently for a second biopsy and decompression.Despite persistent pain and numbness, the patients neurologicalfunction has remained stable 16 years after his initial surgery.Toour knowledge this is the longest postoperative follow-upreported for this condition. The second patient was treated withdexamethasone after biopsy of the affected dura, with completeresolution of symptoms and MRI changes. Prompt and extensivesurgery has been recommended for this condition but experiencewith our second patient indicates that complete remission can beachieved with biopsy and steroid therapy.This is consistent withthe view that hypertrophic pachymeningitis involves anunderlying autoimmune etiology.1,5,6,8-10PATIENTREPORTSPatient 1In January 1981 this 61-year-old man presented with diplopia and atwelfth cranial nerve palsy. He later developed pain in his upper cervicalregion. Amyelogram revealed a complete block at the cervical level.Surgery revealed serous material overlying and encasing the spinalcord and pathologic evaluation of a biopsy disclosed reactive tissue. Hewas treated with steroids and improved, with resolution of allneurological problems except the 12th cranial nerve palsy.In June 1982, he suddenly developed ataxia and weakness in hislower extremities. Physical examination in July revealed sensory lossand upper motor neuron signs below T6. Myelograms revealed adhesive,obliterative arachnoiditis in the lumbar area, complete blocks at T9 andT2, and relative obstruction at C5. CSF contained 34 white blood cellsand 106 mg of protein. There was no documented fever or leucocytosis.Re-exploration was undertaken due to the recurrence of the blockand failure to establish a diagnosis. Laminectomy, with decompressionand exploration of T3 to T5, revealed a thick, nonpulsatile dura andadherent epidural material. The arachnoid was pulsatile but containedopacities throughout.Pathologic examination revealed a markedly thickened dura with anodular chronic inflammatory infiltrate. Small granulomas were notedwith thick rims of epithelioid cells surrounding central collections ofpolymorphonuclear cells. Giant cells were present in a few granulomas.Lymphocytes, histiocytes, plasma cells and occasional polymorpho-nuclear cells surrounded the granulomas. Stains for bacteria includingtubercle bacilli and spirochetes, fungi and protozoa were completelynegative. The histological diagnosis was chronic granulomatousinflammation of dural and epidural tissues of unknown etiology.The patient gradually improved, but in April 1991 experiencedincreased pain in the posterior mid-thoracic region. An MRI revealedlocalized spinal cord atrophy at upper thoracic levels (T2-T4) andincreased cord signal on T2-weighted images from this level distally,consistent with myelomalacia or ischemic/demyelinating changes.Gadolinium-enhanced axial images throughout the thoracic spinerevealed no abnormal enhancement.In 1997, about fifteen years after his second operation, the patientpresented with tightness across his shoulders, activity-induced crampingin the upper extremities and increased numbness in his legs. He was stillable to walk for several hours each day and his bowel and bladderfunction was normal. He had a moderate kyphosis and unchangedneurologic signs. Repeat MRI revealed an atrophic cord and probableposterior tethering at the site of his previous laminectomies. On T2-weighted images the thoracic spinal cord demonstrated focal T2 signalhyperintensity centrally but no definite syrinx.Patient 2A30-year-old woman presented in December 1996, complaining ofdifficulty urinating, with bilateral leg weakness and numbness. MRrevealed a dural lesion extending from approximately the C4 to T3 level(Figures 1 & 2). She subsequently underwent a T1 bilateral laminectomyand biopsy of the lesion. At operation, dark and slightly hemorrhagictissue was observed in the epidural space, dorsal to the dural tube. Thedura appeared thickened and bowed posteriorly. Histopathologicalexamination of the biopsied tissue revealed well-organized connectivetissue, infiltrated by a mixed inflammatory response, with giant cells,plasma cells, occasional eosinophils, and foci of B lymphocytes (Figures3 & 4). Discrete granulomas were not identified. Stains for organisms(bacteria, acid fast bacilli, spirochetes and fungi) were negative. Therewas no evidence of vasculitis. Investigation for lymphoma, infectious,and connective tissue disease was negative. The final diagnosis wasidiopathic spinal pachymeningitis.Postoperatively the patient was continued on dexamethasone, withgradual improvement in her neurologic function. She developed apulmonary embolus and required intensive care. New defects appearedon ventilation perfusion scans despite aggressive therapeutic measuresand an inferior vena cava filter was implanted. Her neurological functioncontinued to improve. She was able to ambulate with a walker and herbladder function returned to baseline. An MRI done before discharge inFebruary revealed almost complete resolution of the cervical andthoracic dural thickening. Asmall amount of residual enhancement wasseen but there was no evidence of cord compression. Arepeat MRI scan done five months after surgery revealed no duralthickening or spinal cord compression. The residual enhancement notedon the first postoperative MRI had completely disappeared. She wasseen one month later, at which time her numbness and weakness hadresolved. Another MRI scan done 12 months postoperatively revealed nonew findings.DISCUSSIONIdiopathic hypertrophic pachymeningitis is a rare but possiblyunderrecognized condition. There are few reports of long-termfollow-up of treated patients.6 , 8 , 11 , 1 2Optimal therapy iscontroversial. Our patients initially underwent biopsy and steroidtherapy, with improvement in neurological function. In the firstpatient, an early relapse has been followed by more than 15 yearsof stable neurological function. Increased thoracic pain andsubjective numbness were likely the result of surgical treatment,as radiologic and neurologic signs of progression were absent.Thus our first patient, with the longest follow-up reported,suggests a relatively favorable long-term prognosis for somepatients with this disorder.The diagnosis of idiopathic hypertrophic pachymeningitisdepends on excluding causative diseases, particularly thosewhich call for specific treatment. The natural history is poorlydefined. Areview of the English and Japanese literature onidiopathic hypertrophic spinal pachymeningitis led to theconclusion that patients with inflammatory signs (fever,increased sedimentation rate, leukocytosis, or increased C-reactive protein) had a poorer prognosis than patients withoutinflammatory signs.13THE CANADIAN JOURNALOF NEUROLOGICALSCIENCES334Associated diseasesHypertrophic pachymeningitis can be associated withinfectious agents, autoimmune disorders, and otherp r o c e s s e s .2 , 4 , 1 4 - 1 7It should be distinguished from duralhypertrophy without inflammation18and from enhancement ofthe dura on neuroimaging without documented hypertrophy orinflammation.19Sarcoidosis can present with findings similar tohypertrophic pachymeningitis.20-23LE JOURNALCANADIEN DES SCIENCES NEUROLOGIQUESVolume 27, No. 4  November 2000335Figure 1:Patient 2.

They divided the clinical presentation into three distinctstages: 1) intermittent radicular pain that eventually becamecontinuous; 2) muscle weakness and atrophy; 3) spastic paralysisand loss of sphincter control. However, leg weakness ornumbness, sometimes associated with bladder dysfunction, andevolving over two weeks to a year, is a characteristic presentingcomplaint (our patient 2;4,11,13). Radicular signs and symptomsconfined to the upper extremities may occur.41Signs may evolveover a longer time interval.42The cranial form of hypertrophicpachymeningitis frequently presents with headache, cranialneuropathies and ataxia.43Radiologic findingsIn general, hypertrophic pachymeningitis lesions appearhypointense relative to brain or spinal cord on T1- and, to agreater extent, on T2-weighted images. Contrast-enhanced MRImay show more intense enhancement at the periphery of thelesions with central signal hypointensity, as in our patient 2,possibly due to greater enhancement in an active zone ofinflammation peripherally than in a central zone of densef i b r o s i s .4 4Nonetheless, pathologic confirmation remainsessential. It is often only after histopathologic examination ofdura mater that the diagnosis can be entertained and a search forpotential causes carried out. PathologyGrossly observable thickening or inflammation of the duramater may occur in association with meningioma, craniopharyn-gioma, lymphoma, metastatic carcinoma, and other tumors.Infectious processes involving the sinuses, middle ear, epidural,or subdural locations can produce inflammation and thickeningof the dura. Hence the clinical and radiologic findings andobservations at surgery are essential for interpretation of thepathology; and a search for infectious causes is mandatory.H i s t o l o g i c a l l y, distinction between inflammation and aneoplastic proliferation of lymphoid, plasmacytic, or histiocyticelements is fundamental. Most cases of idiopathic pachy-meningitis are characterized by a nonnecrotizing chronicinflammatory infiltrate of lymphocytes, plasma cells, andoccasional histiocytes, giant cells, polymorphonuclear cells, oreosinophils.1,4,6,16,17,41,45-48Granulomas, necrosis and vasculitisare less frequently identified.2,12-14,49Dural involvement has been reported in neurosarcoidosis butinvolvement of the leptomeninges and substance of the centralnervous system are more typical.20-22,50Even when involvementis preferentially dural, there is usually an obvious mass, typicallysubdural, evoking meningioma; but the pattern may be sarcoiden-plaque51,52or pachymeningitis.22,53-55Biopsy of affected dura in sarcoid usually reveals thecharacteristic noncaseating granuloma. In contrast, biopsy ofinvolved dura in rheumatoid arthritis usually reveals onlynonspecific inflammation, and the association ofpachymeningitis with rheumatoid arthritis relies on other clinicalevidence.35,36Rheumatoid nodules may involve dura mater insymptomatic pachymeningitis but, to our knowledge, they havebeen discovered only at autopsy.35ManagementThe Table summarizes methods and outcomes of treatment inTHE CANADIAN JOURNALOF NEUROLOGICALSCIENCES338Author(Ref No)AgeSexDescriptionTreatmentOutcomeMamelak et al4967FIntracranialSteroidsProgression50FIntracranialSurgical resection (x2), Improvement, then recurrenceSteroids75MIntracranialSteroidsImprovement of symptoms; died of cardiopulmonary arrestMasson et al1258FIntracranialVPshunt, Steroids,Little improvement, dead 10 yrs laterRadiotherapy, azathioprine20FIntracranialSteroids and azathioprineAsymptomatic at 6 years57MIntracranialSteroids, radiotherapy,Little improvement, dead 5 yrs laterazathioprine41MIntracranialAnticonvulsants, VPShuntAsymptomatic at 10 years50FIntracranialAsymptomatic at 1 yearLam et al6064FIntracranialSteroidsSymptoms improved at 11 months41MIntracranialSteroidsSymptoms improved at 7 months70MIntracranialSteroidsSymptoms improved at 12 monthsShintani et al772MIntracranialSteroidsSymptoms improvedNo change in MRI at 2 monthsWilling and Broghamer5 835FIntracranialSteroidsUnavailableMartin et al5720FIntracranialSteroids, then azathioprineAsymptomatic at 15 months58FIntracranialSteroids and radiotherapyProgression58MIntracranialSteroids and azathioprineSymptomatic and MRI improvement at 17 monthsKobayashi et al5640MIntracranialSteroidsLittle improvement, died soon after68MIntracranialSteroids, VPshuntLittle improvement, died of pneumoniapatients with hypertrophic pachymeningitis in which MRI or CTdocumentation was available. Most of these patients wereidiopathic. Since management differs for the cranial (ICHP) andspinal (ISHP) forms, we separately address their mangement here.As illustrated in the Table, therapeutic strategies for ICHPhave included steroids,6-8,12,15,16,45,48,49,56-58azathioprine,12,16,45,57m e t h o t r e x a t e ,1 6c h l o r o q u i n e ,1 6r a d i o t h e r a p y,1 2 , 1 6 , 5 7v e n t r i c u l o-peritoneal shunts,1 2 , 5 6antiepileptic drugs,1 2s u rg e r y4 9a n dobservation.59Corticosteroids can decrease the thickness of duraas documented with MRI,6,8,15,45,46,48,57and can result in dramaticreductions of symptoms and complete remission in somep a t i e n t s .6 - 8 , 1 2 , 1 5 , 1 6 , 4 5 , 4 6 , 4 8 , 4 9 , 5 7 , 6 0Patients may become steroid-dependent.46Azathioprine may be introduced in an effort to taperthe corticosteroids.16Early results from the use of azathioprinehave been promising9 , 1 2 , 1 6 , 4 5 , 5 7but the efficacy of chronicazathioprine therapy remains poorly documented. Radiotherapy probably confers no benefit,1 2 , 5 7d e s p i t eoccasional reports of improvement.16Surgical techniques andventriculoperitoneal shunts have been used with variablesuccess.12,47,49,56An empiric trial of antituberculous therapy maybe warranted in selected patients.5For ISHP, radical surgical treatment has been recommendedas the only therapy.43Others have emphasized early surgicalexcision of thickened dura1 3or surgical decompression bylaminectomy and excision of the involved dura.11 , 6 1Immunosuppressive therapy may obviate the need for extensivesurgery. Corticosteroids may achieve symptomatic control9,11and reduction in dural thickness,13which can be virtuallycomplete, as in our second patient. Decompression may be necessary but our first patientdemonstrates that extensive laminectomies can result in chronicdiscomfort. If decompressive surgery is necessary,laminoplasties should be performed instead of laminectomies,because of the enhanced spinal stability and reduced pain aftersurgery.11For the management of ISHP, we advocate surgical biopsyand the use of corticosteroids. Azathioprine may be integratedinto the therapeutic regimen as noted above in the treatment ofICHP. If stabilization of neurological function is not achieved,surgical intervention with laminoplasty and excision of involveddura should be done.The need for long-term prospective studies of patients withIHPis apparent. Because of the rarity of the disorder, a NorthAmerican or worldwide registry of patients may be warranted.E fforts to delineate the epidemiology and underlyingautoimmune components of the pathogenesis should beemphasized.REFERENCES1.Botella C, Orozco M, Navarro J, Riesgo P.
