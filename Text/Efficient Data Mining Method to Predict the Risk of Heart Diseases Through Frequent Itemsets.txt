2015 Efficient Data Mining Method to Predict the Risk of Heart Diseases 
through Frequent Itemsets Ilayaraja M*, Meyyappan T Department of Computer Science and Engineerring, Alagappa University, Karaikudi-630 003, Tamil Nadu, India 
Abstract Data mining techniques are used in the field of medicine for various purposes.  Mining association rule is one of the interesti
ng 
topics in data mining which is used to generate frequent items
ets.  It was first proposed for ma
rket basket analysis.  Research
ers 
proposed variations in techniques to generate frequent itemsets. Generating large number of frequent itemsets is a time 
consuming process.  In this paper, the authors devised a method to predict the risk level of the patients having heart disease 
through frequent itemsets.  The dataset of various heart disease patients are used for this research work.  Frequent itemsets a
re generated based on the chosen symptoms and minimum support v
alue.  The extracted frequent itemsets help the medical 
practitioner to make diagnostic decisions and determine the risk level of patients at an early stage.  The proposed method can 
be applied to any medical dataset to predict the risk factors with risk level of the patients based on chosen factors.  An experim
ental 
result shows that the developed method identifies the risk level of patients efficiently from frequent itemsets.

1.Introduction  
Data mining is now widely used in many domains.  It pl
ays an important role in the clin
ical field.  Day by day, 
large numbers of patients are visiting hosp
itals for the purpose of various treatments.  Number of patients records 
are increasing in every department in the hospital.  In medical field, data mining algorithms are used to mine the 
hidden knowledge in the dataset of the medical domain [1]
.  The discovered patterns may aid decision making and 
saving of lives.  Various data mining approaches such as cl
assification, clustering, associ
ation rule mining, statistical

learning and link mining, all have their significance in data
 research and development [2].  Association rule mining 
is a most efficient algorithm for extracting frequent itemsets from huge data. 
 To find out the frequent itemsets, 
minimum support value has been used.  Support value of the itemset greater than or equal to minimum support value 
is called frequent itemset.  If an itemset is frequent, then all of its subsets also must be frequent [3]. 
Heart disease is the one of the leadin
g human killer diseases.  In United S
tates, the cause of death for both men 
and women is primarily by heart disease.  It is an 
equal opportunity killer which 
claims approximately 1 million 
lives annually.  The disease had killed nearly 787,000 pe
ople alone in 2011 and 380,
000 people annually by heart disease.  Every 30 seconds someone has a heart attack and someone dies from a heart related disease in every 60 

seconds [4].   
In this paper, the authors proposed a 
new mining method to predi
ct the risk level of heart disease based on chosen 
symptoms by analyzing the heart disease dataset.  The predictions of this method will help the medical practitioners 
in making diagnostic decisions to save lives of patients at risk. 
2.Literature Review  
Usha Rani et al. has introduced pincer search algorithm 
to discover the maximum frequent itemset [5].  It also 
reduces number of times the database is scanned.  Fre
quent itemset mining without the generation of conditional 
frequent pattern tress was expressed by Meera Narvekar et al. [6]. The desired association rules are also discovered 
from the frequent itemset.  Alagugowri et al. developed 
a predicting system to predict the heart disease [7].  K-
Means clustering technique is used to 
distinguish the risky and non-risky factors to categorize.  Tzung-Pei Hong et 
al. developed MFFP-Tree Fuzzy Mining Algorithm to find out the linguistic frequent Itemsets [8].  Marghny et al. 

has developed a new method to mine frequent itemset 
by avoiding the costly candidate generation-and-test 
processing.  It also compresses essential information 
about all itemset, minimal and maximal length of frequent 
itemsets and database scans repeatedly [9].  Jahangir Kabir 
et al. proposed a novel method to determine maximal 
frequent itemsets with genetic algorithm 
[10].  The weighted support measure is
 introduced by Subrata Bose et al. 
that adopted a balanced approach to mine frequent pattern
s [11].  To mine frequent closed sequential pattern in 
temporal transaction data, Antonio Gomari
z et al. proposed a ClaSP algorithm 
[12].  To mine frequent itemset based 
on nodesets, an efficient FIN algorithm was developed by Zhi-Hong Deng et al. [13].  Hai Duong et al. developed a 

new algorithm with double constraint
s to find out all frequent itemsets [14].  Mengchi Liu et al. proposed a HUI-
Miner (High Utility Itemset Miner) algorithm to mine high utility itemset [15].  Umair Shafique et al. implemented 

three various algorithms (Neural Network, Decision Tree 
and Nave Bayes) to discov
er interesting patterns from 
heart patients data.  The results reveal that the Nave Bayes algorithm has the highest accuracy among them [16].  

Darshan M. Tank has proposed an algorithm to reduce pruning 
operations.  It uses aprior
i-gen operation to generate 
the candidate itemsets-2 and also it calculates support value qui
ckly by adopting the tag-counting method [3].  Deepa 
S. Deshpande proposed a novel method 
for mining association rule using patter 
generation.  To find out frequent 
feature set, the Boolean operations fo
r pattern generation is adopted [17].  Zhou Zhiping et al. introduced matrix-
based sorting index association rules algorithm to find th
e frequency k-itemsets directly.
  It discovers k-itemsets 
directly when frequent item sets are higher [18].  Chanchal Yadav et al. developed a new algorithm to decrease the 

pruning operation of candidate itemset.  It also reduces storage space requirement [2].  Amr Jadi et al. proposed an 

algorithm to predict and mitig
ate the risks by using runtime 
monitoring with neural ne
tworks [19].  Sallam Osman 
Fageeri et al. introduced a binary-based technique to find
 out the frequent itemsets that outperforms classic Apriori 
algorithm in terms of running time [20].  To estimate th
e size of candidate itemsets in Apriori based algorithms, 
linear algebra method was used by Savo Tomovi
 et al. [21].  Sen Su et al. has de
signed differentially private FIM 
algorithm to offer high time efficiency rath
er than achieve high data utility and 
degree of privacy [22].
  This survey 
indicates that many algorithms were
 developed by researchers to genera
te frequent itemsets.  A new method 
proposed in this paper generates frequent itemsets effi
ciently based on chosen symptoms and support value. 
3.Data Source  
Simulated heart disease dataset containing 1000 patient 
records are used for this research work.  This dataset 
contains 19 symptoms as shown in Table 1.  They are the symptoms of various heart diseases, namely

provides a rapid aid to the medical practitioner in making em
ergency decisions to save the lives of patients at risk 
level. In the proposed method, symp
toms representing columns and patient 
records representing rows are removed 
from further analysis, if they do not satisfy the chosen rules.  The proposed 
method is applied over a heart disease 
dataset of 1000 records of patients suffering from various heart related diseases.  The prediction results are 
encouraging and the efficiency of the 
method in frequent itemset generation 
is better than existing methods.
